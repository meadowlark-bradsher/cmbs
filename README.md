# CMBS v0 Core

CMBS is a belief-state accounting system. It tracks hypotheses, eliminations, entropy, and obligation discipline using opaque identifiers. The core is domain-agnostic and replay-auditable.

## Why CMBS Exists

Long-horizon agents often carry belief implicitly in prompts, hidden state, or logs, making it hard to enforce invariants, audit trajectories, or replay decisions.
CMBS externalizes belief as an explicit, monotone state machine:
hypotheses can only be eliminated, never reintroduced, and every update is recorded in a replayable audit log.
This allows belief bookkeeping to be separated from policy, learning, and execution.

CMBS does not:
- Execute or schedule probes
- Choose actions or control workflows
- Interpret observables or hypotheses

All semantics live in adapters.

CMBS is designed to be used alongside frozen or learning agents, not embedded within them.

## Quick Start

```python
from cmbs.core import CMBSCore

core = CMBSCore(hypothesis_ids={"H1", "H2", "H3"})
result = core.submit_probe_result(
    probe_id="P1",
    observable_id="O1",
    eliminated={"H1"},
)
assert result.accepted
```

## Legacy Replay Shim

For audit continuity with legacy logs, use the thin adapter in `cmbs.adapters.legacy`:

```python
from cmbs.core import CMBSCore
from cmbs.adapters.legacy import LegacyReplayAdapter, LegacyEliminationEvent

core = CMBSCore(hypothesis_ids={"H1", "H2"})
adapter = LegacyReplayAdapter(core)

adapter.submit_elimination_event(
    LegacyEliminationEvent(
        probe_id="legacy:probe:001",
        observable_id="legacy:obs:alpha",
        eliminated_hypotheses={"H2"},
    )
)
```
