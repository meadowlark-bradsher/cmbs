# Legacy Archive

The `/archive` directory contains legacy CMBS artifacts preserved for historical reference and audit continuity. These files include pre-v0 supervisors, control loops, domain-specific harnesses, and analysis notes from the legacy `cmbs` repository.

They exist to support traceability and migration review only. They must not be used as a base for new development or as guidance for CMBS v0 core behavior.

If a file answers “what should the agent do next?”, it belongs in the archive, not in the core.

## Where The Legacy Files Live

The legacy archive lives outside this vault at:

```
../archive/
```
