This software allows players to experience the traditional 8x8 Checkers game, complete with standard capture and kinging rules.\n\n## \ud83c\udfb2 Game Features\n\n- **Interactive Gameplay**: Two-player alternating turns.\n- **Standard Rules**: Implements standard Checkers rules including captures and kinging.\n- **Multiple Sequential Captures**: Supports multiple sequential captures in a single turn.\n- **Simple Notation**: Players input moves using a straightforward notation (e.g., `5,0-4,1`).\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Installation\n\n1. **Clone the repository** or download the provided files (`piece.py`, `board.py`, `main.py`, `example_move.py`):\n\n```bash\ngit clone <repository-url>\ncd <repository-directory>\n```\n\n*(Replace `<repository-url>` and `<repository-directory>` with the actual URL and directory name.)*\n\n2. **Install Dependencies**\n\nThis project does not require any external dependencies. However, ensure your Python environment is correctly set up.\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n*(Note: The provided `requirements.txt` file is empty, as no external dependencies are required.)*\n\n## \ud83c\udfae How to Play\n\n### Starting the Game\n\nRun the game by executing the `main.py` script:\n\n```bash\npython main.py\n```\n\n### Understanding the Board\n\nThe board is displayed in an 8x8 grid format with rows and columns numbered from 0 to 7:\n\n- `W` represents a White piece.\n- `B` represents a Black piece.\n- `WK` or `BK` represents a Kinged piece.\n- `.` represents an empty square.\n\nExample board visualization:\n\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n0 . B . B . B . B \n1 B . B . B . B . \n2 . B . B . B . B \n3 . . . . . . . . \n4 . . . . . . . . \n5 W . W . W . W . \n6 . W . W . W . W \n7 W . W . W . W . \n```\n\n### Making a Move\n\nMoves are entered using the notation `from_row,from_col-to_row,to_col`. For example, to move a piece from position `(5,0)` to `(4,1)`, input:\n\n```\n5,0-4,1\n```\n\n### Capturing Pieces\n\nTo capture an opponent's piece, jump over it diagonally to an empty square immediately beyond it. For example, if your piece is at `(5,0)` and an opponent's piece is at `(4,1)`, you can capture it by moving to `(3,2)`:\n\n```\n5,0-3,2\n```\n\n### Multiple Sequential Captures\n\nIf after capturing a piece, another capture is possible with the same piece, you must continue capturing. The game will prompt you to continue capturing with the same piece until no further captures are possible.\n\n### Kinging a Piece\n\nWhen a piece reaches the farthest row from its starting position (row `0` for White, row `7` for Black), it becomes a King (`WK` or `BK`). Kings can move and capture in both forward and backward diagonal directions.\n\n### Winning the Game\n\nThe game continues until one player has no remaining pieces. The player with remaining pieces is declared the winner.\n\n## \ud83d\udccc Example Move\n\nTo see an example of a valid move notation, run the provided `example_move.py` script:\n\n```bash\npython example_move.py\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n5,0-4,1\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 File Structure\n\n- `piece.py`: Defines the `Piece` class representing individual checker pieces.\n- `board.py`: Manages the game state, validates moves, and handles game logic.\n- `main.py`: Main executable script implementing the game loop and user interaction.\n- `example_move.py`: Demonstrates valid move notation.\n- `requirements.txt`: Lists external dependencies (currently none required).\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Troubleshooting\n\n- **Invalid Input**: Ensure your move notation is correct (`row,col-row,col`) and within bounds (`0-7`).\n- **Invalid Move**: Moves must follow Checkers rules. Ensure you are moving diagonally, capturing correctly, and following kinging rules.\n\n## \ud83d\udcde Support\n\nFor further assistance or to report issues, please contact our support team or open an issue in the project's repository.\n\nEnjoy your game of Checkers! \ud83c\udf89\n```",

    "content": "### Bug Summary:\n\nThe provided test report indicates the following error:\n\n```\n_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable\n```\n\n### Bug Explanation:\n\nThis error occurs because the application attempts to initialize a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter in an environment without a graphical display (such as a headless server or a remote environment without GUI support). Tkinter requires a graphical environment to render its interface.\n\n### Location of Bug:\n\n- **File:** `dashboard.py`\n- **Line:** 10\n- **Code causing the issue:**\n  ```python\n  self.root = tk.Tk()\n  ```\n\n### Suggested Solution:\n\nTo resolve this issue, you have the following options:\n\n1. **Run the application in an environment with GUI support**:\n   - Ensure the `$DISPLAY` environment variable is set correctly.\n   - Run the application on a local machine or a remote machine with GUI capabilities.\n\n2. **Use a virtual display (headless GUI)**:\n   - Utilize tools like `Xvfb` (X Virtual Framebuffer) to simulate a graphical environment.\n   - Example:\n     ```sh\n     sudo apt-get install xvfb\n     xvfb-run python main.py\n     ```\n\n3. **Modify the application to handle headless environments gracefully**:\n   - Add a check to detect if a display is available before initializing the GUI.\n   - Provide a command-line interface (CLI) fallback or informative error message if no GUI is available.\n\nExample modification to handle headless environments gracefully:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom tkinter import messagebox\nimport os\nimport sys\n\nclass Dashboard:\n    def __init__(self, budget_tracker):\n        self.budget_tracker = budget_tracker\n\n        if not os.environ.get('DISPLAY'):\n            print(\"Error: No graphical display found. Please run the application in a GUI-enabled environment.\")\n            sys.exit(1)\n\n        self.root = tk.Tk()\n        self.root.title(\"Budget Tracker Dashboard\")\n        # Rest of your GUI initialization code...\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe bug is caused by attempting to launch a Tkinter GUI in an environment without graphical display support. Implementing one of the suggested solutions above will resolve the issue.",

To fix this, I added a check at the beginning of the `Dashboard` class's `__init__` method to verify if the `$DISPLAY` environment variable is set. If it is not set, the application prints an informative error message and exits gracefully. This ensures the application handles headless environments robustly and provides clear feedback to the user.",

Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, is a strategic board game traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a 15x15 board. The objective is to be the first player to form an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Features\n\n- Standard 15x15 Gomoku board.\n- Two-player interactive gameplay.\n- Automatic win detection.\n- Clear and intuitive command-line interface.\n- Input validation and error handling.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb Requirements\n\nThis Gomoku game is implemented entirely in Python and does not require any external dependencies.\n\n### Python Version\n\n- Python 3.x (recommended Python 3.6 or later)\n\n---\n\n## \u2699\ufe0f Installation\n\n### Step 1: Clone the Repository\n\nClone the repository or download the source code files (`gomoku.py` and `main.py`) to your local machine.\n\n```bash\ngit clone <repository-url>\ncd <repository-directory>\n```\n\nAlternatively, manually download and save the provided files (`gomoku.py` and `main.py`) into a dedicated directory.\n\n### Step 2: Set Up the Environment\n\nSince there are no external dependencies, you only need Python installed on your system. Verify your Python installation by running:\n\n```bash\npython --version\n```\n\nIf Python is not installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfae How to Play\n\n### Starting the Game\n\nNavigate to the directory containing the game files and run the following command:\n\n```bash\npython main.py\n```\n\n### Gameplay Instructions\n\n1. **Game Start**: The game begins with Player B (Black stones) making the first move.\n2. **Making a Move**: Players alternate turns placing their stones on the board. To place a stone, enter the row and column numbers separated by a space when prompted.\n\nExample input:\n\n```\nEnter row and column (separated by space): 7 7\n```\n\n3. **Rules**:\n   - You cannot place a stone on an occupied cell.\n   - Moves must be within the bounds of the 15x15 board (rows and columns numbered from 0 to 14).\n\n4. **Winning the Game**: The first player to form an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.\n\n5. **Draw Condition**: If all cells are occupied and no player has formed a row of five stones, the game ends in a draw.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 Game Interface\n\nThe game board is displayed in the terminal after each move. The board uses the following symbols:\n\n- `.` : Empty cell\n- `B` : Black stone (Player B)\n- `W` : White stone (Player W)\n\nExample of the board display:\n\n```\n    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14\n 0  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n 1  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n 2  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n 3  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n 4  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n 5  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n 6  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n 7  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

Examples:\n\n- Move a pawn from e2 to e4:\n```\ne2e4\n```\n\n- Castling kingside (short castling):\n```\nO-O\n```\n\n- Castling queenside (long castling):\n```\nO-O-O\n```\n\n- Pawn promotion (promote pawn at e7 to Queen at e8):\n```\ne7e8Q\n```\n\n### Gameplay Flow\n\n- The game alternates turns between White and Black.\n- After each move, the updated board is displayed.\n- The game automatically checks for valid moves, checks, checkmate, and stalemate conditions.\n- If an invalid move is entered, the game will prompt you to try again.\n\n### Ending the Game\n\n- The game ends automatically when a checkmate or stalemate is detected.\n- The winner or draw condition is announced clearly in the terminal.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Game Rules and Special Moves\n\n### Castling\n\n- Allowed only if neither the king nor the rook has moved.\n- No pieces between the king and rook.\n- The king cannot castle through, into, or out of check.\n\n### En Passant\n\n- Special pawn capture available immediately after an opponent's pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands beside your pawn.\n\n### Pawn Promotion\n\n- When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it can be promoted to a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Troubleshooting\n\n- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed by running:\n```bash\npython --version\n```\n\n- If you encounter any unexpected behavior, verify your move notation and ensure it follows the provided examples.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcde Support\n\nFor any issues, questions, or feature requests, please contact our support team at [support@chatdev.com](mailto:support@chatdev.com).\n\nEnjoy your game! \u265f\ufe0f\n```",

Combine tiles with matching numbers to reach higher values and achieve the highest possible score!\n\n## \ud83c\udfae What is 2048?\n\n2048 is a popular single-player sliding tile puzzle game played on a 4x4 grid. The objective is to slide numbered tiles on the grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. Each move slides all tiles in one direction (up, down, left, or right). Tiles with the same number merge into one tile with double the value. After each move, a new tile (with a value of 2 or occasionally 4) appears randomly in an empty cell. The game ends when no moves are possible.\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Features\n\n- Standard 4x4 grid gameplay.\n- Simple keyboard controls (W/A/S/D keys).\n- Automatic tile merging and scoring.\n- Real-time score tracking.\n- Highest tile tracking.\n- Game-over detection.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.x installed on your system.

For example:\n\n   ```\n   Apple, Banana, Orange, Grape\n   ```\n\n3. **Shuffle Words:**  \n   If you're stuck, you can shuffle the words to see them in a new arrangement. Simply type:\n\n   ```\n   shuffle\n   ```\n\n4. **Feedback and Mistakes:**  \n   - **Correct Guess:** The words are removed from the grid, and the category along with its difficulty level is revealed in color.\n   - **Incorrect Guess:** You receive immediate feedback, and your mistake count increases by one. Remember, you can only make 4 mistakes!\n\n5. **Winning the Game:**  \n   Successfully group all words into their correct categories before reaching 4 mistakes to win the game.\n\n6. **Game Over:**  \n   If you reach 4 mistakes, the game ends, and you'll have to wait until tomorrow for a new puzzle.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc Example Gameplay\n\n```\nCurrent Puzzle Grid:\nApple          Dog            Red            Car            \nBanana         Cat            Blue           Bike           \nOrange         Rabbit         Green          Bus            \nGrape          Hamster        Yellow         Train          \n\nMistakes: 0/4\nSelect 4 words separated by commas (or type 'shuffle' to shuffle): Apple, Banana, Orange, Grape\nCorrect! Category: Fruits (Difficulty: Yellow)\n\nCurrent Puzzle Grid:\nDog            Red            Car            Cat            \nBlue           Bike           Rabbit         Green          \nBus            Hamster        Yellow         Train          \n\nMistakes: 0/4\nSelect 4 words separated by commas (or type 'shuffle' to shuffle): Dog, Cat, Rabbit, Hamster\nCorrect! Category: Pets (Difficulty: Green)\n\n...\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 Tips and Strategies\n\n- **Look for Patterns:** Words may seem to fit multiple categories. Think carefully before making your selection.\n- **Use Shuffle Wisely:** Shuffling can help you see new connections between words.\n- **Manage Mistakes:** Be cautious with your guesses to avoid reaching the mistake limit too quickly.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcde Support and Feedback\n\nEncountered an issue or have suggestions? We'd love to hear from you! Please reach out to our support team or open an issue in our repository.\n\nHappy puzzling! \ud83e\udde0\u2728\n\n````",

This software provides an engaging and interactive word search puzzle experience inspired by the popular NYT Strands puzzle. Players will uncover themed words hidden within a 6x8 grid of letters, with a special challenge word called the \"spangram\" that connects two opposite sides of the board.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Main Features\n\n- **Interactive Word Search:** Discover themed words hidden within a 6x8 grid.\n- **Spangram Challenge:** Find the special \"spangram\" word that touches two opposite sides of the puzzle board.\n- **Dynamic Highlighting:** Themed words highlight in blue, and the spangram highlights in yellow for easy identification.\n- **Flexible Word Formation:** Words can be formed by connecting adjacent letters in any direction (vertically, horizontally, diagonally) and can change direction mid-word.\n- **Hint System:** Earn hints by finding non-theme words. Every 3 non-theme words discovered unlocks a new hint.\n- **Puzzle Completion:** Complete the puzzle by finding all theme words and the spangram, filling the entire board.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udce6 Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Installation Steps\n\n1. **Clone or Download the Repository**\n\n   Clone the repository using Git:\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   cd <repository-directory>\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, download and extract the ZIP file to your preferred directory.\n\n2. **Set Up the Environment**\n\n   This project does not require any external dependencies. However, it is recommended to use a virtual environment for better management:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Installation**\n\n   Ensure you have the following files in your project directory:\n   ```\n   puzzle_board.py\n   game.py\n   main.py\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfae How to Play\n\n### Starting the Game\n\nRun the game by executing the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\npython main.py\n```\n\nYou will see the welcome message and the initial puzzle board displayed in your terminal.\n\n### Game Rules\n\n- **Finding Words:** Enter words by specifying the word followed by the positions of each letter in the format `WORD x1,y1 x2,y2 ...`. Positions are zero-indexed, with `(0,0)` representing the top-left corner of the board.\n\n  **Example:**\n  ```\n  PYTHON 0,0 1,0 2,0 2,1 2,2 3,2\n  ```\n\n- **Word Validation:** The game will validate your input. If the word and positions are correct, you will receive confirmation:\n  - **Theme Word Found:** Highlights in blue.\n  - **Spangram Found:** Highlights in yellow.\n  - **Non-theme Word Found:** Every 3 non-theme words found unlocks a hint.\n\n- **Hints:** After unlocking hints, the game will inform you of the number of available hints. Use these hints strategically to complete the puzzle.\n\n- **Puzzle Completion:** The game ends when you successfully find all theme words and the spangram, filling the entire puzzle board.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Interface Guide\n\n- **Puzzle Board Display:**\n  - Letters enclosed in `[ ]` indicate theme words you've found (highlighted in blue).\n  - Letters enclosed in `( )` indicate the spangram you've found (highlighted in yellow).\n  - Unhighlighted letters are displayed plainly.\n\n- **User Input:**\n  - Follow the input format strictly to ensure correct validation.\n  - Incorrect formats or invalid paths will prompt an error message.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Example Gameplay\n\n```\nWelcome to the NYT Strands Puzzle!\n\n .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n\nEnter a word and positions (e.g., WORD x1,y1 x2,y2 ...): PYTHON 0,0 1,0 2,0 2,1 2,2 3,2\nTheme word found!\n\n[P][Y][T] .  .  .  .  .\n .  .

This game allows two players to compete by alternately placing discs into a seven-column, six-row grid. The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs.\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Features\n\n- Interactive command-line interface.\n- Clear visual representation of the game board.\n- Automatic validation of player moves.\n- Detection of winning conditions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).\n- Detection of draw conditions when the board is full.\n- Easy-to-follow prompts and error messages.\n\n## \u2699\ufe0f Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.\n\n2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.\n\n3. Install dependencies (no external dependencies required):\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n*(Note: This project does not require external dependencies, so the above command will not install any additional packages.)*\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 How to Play\n\n### Starting the Game\n\nRun the game by executing the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\npython main.py\n```\n\n### Gameplay Instructions\n\n- The game starts with Player X.\n- Players alternate turns, choosing a column number (0-6) to drop their disc.\n- The disc will occupy the lowest available space in the chosen column.\n- After each move, the board updates and displays the current state.\n- The game continues until one player forms a line of four discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until the board is full, resulting in a draw.\n\n### Making Moves\n\n- When prompted, enter the column number (0-6) where you want to place your disc.\n- Example:\n\n```\nPlayer X, choose a column (0-6): 3\n```\n\n### Winning the Game\n\n- The game automatically checks for a winning condition after each move.\n- If a player successfully connects four discs, the game announces the winner and ends.\n\n### Draw Condition\n\n- If all spaces on the board are filled without any player connecting four discs, the game announces a draw.\n\n### Exiting the Game\n\n- To exit the game at any time, press `Ctrl+C`.\n\n## \ud83d\udcc2 Project Structure\n\n```\nconnect-four-game/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 connect_four.py      # Contains the ConnectFourGame class and game logic\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py              # Main executable file to run the game\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt     # Lists external dependencies (none required)\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Code Overview\n\n- `connect_four.py`: Defines the `ConnectFourGame` class, managing the game state, validating moves, checking for wins/draws, and switching players.\n- `main.py`: Provides the command-line interface, handles user input, and manages the game loop.\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 Example Gameplay\n\n```\nWelcome to Connect Four!\n\nCurrent Board:\n-----------------------------\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n-----------------------------\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n-----------------------------\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n-----------------------------\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n-----------------------------\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n-----------------------------\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n-----------------------------\n  0   1   2   3   4   5   6\nPlayer X, choose a column (0-6): 3\n\nCurrent Board:\n-----------------------------\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n-----------------------------\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n-----------------------------\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n-----------------------------\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n-----------------------------\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n-----------------------------\n|   |   |   | X |   |   |   |\n-----------------------------\n  0   1   2   3   4   5   6\nPlayer O, choose a column (0-6):\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udcde Support\n\nFor any questions, issues, or suggestions, please contact our support team or open an issue in the project's repository.\n\nEnjoy playing Connect Four! \ud83c\udf89\n```",

This software faithfully implements the standard rules, including bidding to determine the landlord, valid card combinations, and the pass-or-beat logic.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfb4 Overview of Dou Dizhu\n\nDou Dizhu (\u6597\u5730\u4e3b), literally \"Fight the Landlord,\" is a popular Chinese card game played by three players. One player becomes the \"landlord,\" and the other two players form a team to compete against the landlord. The objective is to be the first player to discard all cards or, if you're on the opposing team, prevent the landlord from doing so.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Main Features\n\n- **Standard 54-card Deck:** Includes two Jokers (Black Joker and Red Joker).\n- **Automatic Shuffling and Dealing:** Cards are shuffled and dealt automatically.\n- **Interactive Bidding Phase:** Players bid to become the landlord.\n- **Landlord Determination:** The landlord receives three extra bottom cards.\n- **Valid Card Combinations:** Supports singles, pairs, and Joker bombs.\n- **Pass-or-Beat Logic:** Players must beat the previous combination or pass.\n- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players input their moves via the command line.\n- **Win Condition:** Automatically detects and announces the winner.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udce5 Installation and Setup\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Installation Steps\n\n1. **Clone or Download the Repository**\n\n   Clone the repository using Git:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   cd <repository-directory>\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, download and extract the ZIP file.\n\n2. **Install Dependencies**\n\n   This project does not require any external dependencies. However, ensure your Python environment is properly set up.\n\n   ```bash\n   # No external dependencies required for this project.\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfae How to Play\n\n### Starting the Game\n\nNavigate to the project directory and run the game using the following command:\n\n```bash\npython main.py\n```\n\n### Gameplay Instructions\n\n1. **Bidding Phase**\n\n   - Each player will be shown their hand.\n   - Players will be prompted to bid for the landlord position by typing `y` (yes) or `n` (no).\n   - The first player to bid becomes the landlord and receives the three bottom cards. If no player bids, the first player becomes the landlord by default.\n\n2. **Playing Cards**\n\n   - Players take turns playing cards or passing.\n   - When prompted, enter the cards you wish to play separated by spaces (e.g., `3\u2660 3\u2666`) or type `pass` to skip your turn.\n   - Valid combinations include:\n     - **Single Card:** Any single card.\n     - **Pair:** Two cards of the same rank.\n     - **Joker Bomb:** Both Jokers played together (Black Joker and Red Joker), which beats any other combination.\n\n3. **Pass-or-Beat Logic**\n\n   - You must play a combination that beats the previously played combination or pass.\n   - If no previous combination exists (e.g., after everyone passes), you can play any valid combination.\n\n4. **Winning the Game**\n\n   - The first player to discard all their cards wins.\n   - If the landlord wins, the landlord wins individually.\n   - If either of the other two players wins, both non-landlord players win as a team.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udccf Example Gameplay\n\n```\nPlayer1's hand: 3\u2660 4\u2666 5\u2663 6\u2665 7\u2660 8\u2666 9\u2663 10\u2665 J\u2660 Q\u2666 K\u2663 A\u2665 2\u2660 2\u2666 Black Joker Red Joker\nPlayer1, do you want to bid as landlord?

Enjoy the timeless puzzle game where you strategically rotate and position falling Tetrominoes to clear lines and score points. The game progressively increases in speed, challenging your reflexes and strategic thinking.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Features\n\n- **Classic Gameplay:** Enjoy the traditional Tetris experience with all seven standard Tetromino shapes (I, J, L, O, S, T, Z).\n- **Intuitive Controls:** Move, rotate, and drop Tetrominoes easily using keyboard controls.\n- **Dynamic Difficulty:** Game speed increases progressively as you score higher, providing a challenging experience.\n- **Scoring System:** Clear multiple lines simultaneously to earn bonus points.\n- **Visual Feedback:** Clear and colorful graphics enhance the gaming experience.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udce6 Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nEnsure you have Python (version 3.6 or higher) installed. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Install Dependencies\n\nInstall the required Python package using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can manually install the dependency:\n\n```bash\npip install pygame>=2.0.0\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfae How to Play\n\n### Launching the Game\n\nNavigate to the directory containing the game files and run the following command:\n\n```bash\npython main.py\n```\n\n### Controls\n\n- **Left Arrow (\u2190)**: Move Tetromino left\n- **Right Arrow (\u2192)**: Move Tetromino right\n- **Down Arrow (\u2193)**: Soft drop (move Tetromino down faster)\n- **Up Arrow (\u2191)**: Rotate Tetromino clockwise\n- **Spacebar**: Hard drop (instantly drop Tetromino to the bottom)\n\n### Gameplay Instructions\n\n- Tetrominoes fall from the top of the screen. Your goal is to rotate and position them to create complete horizontal lines.\n- Completed lines are cleared from the board, and you earn points accordingly.\n- The game speed gradually increases as your score increases, making the game progressively more challenging.\n- The game ends when new Tetrominoes cannot enter the board due to existing blocks.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Game Interface\n\n- **Game Board:** The main area where Tetrominoes fall and stack.\n- **Score:** Your current score is calculated based on the number of lines cleared.\n- **Tetrominoes:** Each shape has a unique color for easy identification.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Project Structure\n\n```\nTetrisGame/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py          # Entry point of the game\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 game.py          # Contains the game logic and board management\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 tetromino.py     # Defines Tetromino shapes and rotations\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt # Lists required Python packages\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc Tips and Tricks\n\n- Plan ahead and leave space for upcoming Tetrominoes.\n- Clearing multiple lines simultaneously (especially four lines, known as a \"Tetris\") yields significantly higher scores.\n- Use the hard drop (spacebar) strategically to quickly position Tetrominoes and gain extra points.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd License\n\nThis project is open-source and available for personal and educational use. Feel free to modify and enhance the game according to your preferences.\n\nEnjoy playing Tetris! \ud83c\udf89\n```",

This software provides an interactive and user-friendly implementation of the classic Reversi game, allowing two players to compete on an 8x8 grid. Players alternate placing discs, flipping the opponent's discs that lie between the newly placed piece and existing pieces of the same color. The game automatically identifies valid moves, flips discs accordingly, and displays the current score.\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Main Features\n\n- **Interactive Gameplay:** Two-player interactive gameplay on an 8x8 board.\n- **Automatic Move Validation:** Automatically identifies and displays valid moves for each player.\n- **Disc Flipping Logic:** Automatically flips opponent's discs according to Reversi rules.\n- **Score Tracking:** Real-time score display for both players.\n- **Game Termination Detection:** Automatically detects and announces game termination scenarios (board full or no valid moves remaining).\n- **Robust Error Handling:** Provides clear feedback and error messages for invalid moves or inputs.\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Installation and Setup\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Installation Steps\n\n1. **Clone or Download the Project**\n\n   Clone the repository or download the provided files (`reversi.py`, `main.py`, and `requirements.txt`) to your local machine.\n\n2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**\n\n   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded files.\n\n   ```bash\n   cd path/to/reversi-game\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Dependencies**\n\n   This project does not require any external dependencies. However, it's good practice to create a virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv venv\n   ```\n\n   Activate the virtual environment:\n\n   - On Windows:\n     ```bash\n     venv\\Scripts\\activate\n     ```\n   - On macOS/Linux:\n     ```bash\n     source venv/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n   Since there are no external dependencies, you can skip installing from `requirements.txt`.\n\n## \ud83c\udfae How to Play\n\n### Starting the Game\n\nRun the game by executing the `main.py` file:\n\n```bash\npython main.py\n```\n\n### Gameplay Instructions\n\n- The game begins with the initial setup of four discs placed in the center of the board.\n- Player 'X' starts the game, followed by player 'O'.\n- The game will display the current board state, available valid moves, and the current score after each turn.\n\n### Making a Move\n\n- When prompted, enter your move by specifying the row and column numbers separated by a space. For example, to place a disc at row 2, column 3, type:\n\n  ```\n  2 3\n  ```\n\n- If you enter an invalid move or input, the game will provide clear feedback and prompt you to try again.\n\n### Game Rules\n\n- You must place your disc in a position that captures at least one of your opponent's discs.\n- Capturing occurs when your newly placed disc and another of your discs enclose a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) of your opponent's discs.\n- All enclosed opponent discs are flipped to your color.\n- If a player has no valid moves, the turn automatically passes to the opponent.\n- The game ends when neither player has a valid move or when the board is completely filled.\n\n### Ending the Game\n\n- Upon game termination, the final board state and scores are displayed.\n- The player with the highest score (most discs on the board) wins.\n- In case of a tie, the game will announce the result accordingly.\n\n## \ud83d\udccc Example Gameplay\n\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n0                \n1                \n2                \n3       O X      \n4       X O      \n5                \n6                \n7                \nScore - X: 2 | O: 2\nPlayer X's turn. Valid moves: [(2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 5), (5, 4)]\nEnter your move (row col): 2 3\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udcde Support and Feedback\n\nIf you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please contact our support team at [support@chatdev.com](mailto:support@chatdev.com). We appreciate your feedback and strive to continuously enhance your gaming experience.\n\nEnjoy playing Reversi (Othello) and thank you for choosing ChatDev!\n```",

You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Dependencies\n\nThis project requires no external dependencies. However, it's recommended to create a virtual environment for better project management.\n\n### Setting up the Environment\n\n1. **Clone or Download the Project**\n\n   Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.\n\n2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv storytelling_env\n   ```\n\n3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**\n\n   - On Windows:\n\n     ```bash\n     storytelling_env\\Scripts\\activate\n     ```\n\n   - On macOS/Linux:\n\n     ```bash\n     source storytelling_env/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n4. **Install Dependencies**\n\n   Since there are no external dependencies, you can skip this step. If dependencies are added in the future, you can install them using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n## \u25b6\ufe0f How to Play\n\n### Starting the Game\n\nNavigate to the project directory and run the following command:\n\n```bash\npython main.py\n```\n\n### Gameplay Instructions\n\n1. **Read the Narrative**: The game will present you with a narrative segment describing your current situation.\n\n2. **Make Choices**: After each narrative segment, you'll be presented with numbered choices. Enter the number corresponding to your desired action and press Enter.\n\n   Example:\n   ```\n   You wake up in a mysterious forest. What do you do?\n\n   1. Explore the forest\n   2. Stay put and wait\n\n   Choose an option: 1\n   ```\n\n3. **Progress Through the Story**: Your choices will lead you through different story paths, affecting your inventory and relationships.\n\n4. **Reach an Ending**: Continue making choices until you reach an ending. The game will clearly indicate when you've reached the conclusion of your story.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n\n- **Items**: Certain choices grant you items that can unlock special options later in the story.\n- **Relationships**: Interactions with characters can build relationships, influencing future events and outcomes.\n- **Conditional Choices**: Some choices will only appear if you meet specific conditions (e.g., possessing an item or having a certain relationship status).\n\n## \ud83d\udcc1 Project Structure\n\n```\ninteractive-storytelling-game/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py          # Main entry point for the game\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 story.py         # Defines the story structure and logic\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 player.py        # Manages player state (items, relationships)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt # Lists external dependencies (currently empty)\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd Customizing the Story\n\nYou can easily customize or expand the story by editing the `story.py` file:\n\n- **Adding New Nodes**: Define new `StoryNode` instances with unique IDs, narrative text, choices, conditions, and effects.\n- **Modifying Choices**: Adjust existing choices or add new ones to existing nodes.\n- **Conditional Logic**: Set conditions and effects to create more complex and interactive storylines.\n\nExample of adding a new node:\n\n```python\nself.nodes['new_adventure'] = StoryNode(\n    'new_adventure',\n    \"You discover a hidden cave. Do you enter?\",\n    choices=[\n        {'text': \"Enter the cave\", 'next_node': 'cave_entry', 'effects': {'items': ['torch']}},\n        {'text': \"Walk away\", 'next_node': 'walk_away'}\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udcde Support\n\nFor any questions, feedback, or issues, please contact our support team or open an issue in the project's repository.\n\nEnjoy your adventure and happy storytelling! \ud83c\udf1f\n```",

The game challenges your timing and strategy skills, with increasing difficulty as you progress through levels.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Features\n\n- **Dynamic Claw Movement:** Control a claw that moves horizontally back and forth, automatically grabbing objects within range.\n- **Multiple Object Types:** Collect gold, diamonds, and avoid rocks. Each object has unique values and weights affecting your score and reel-in time.\n- **Level Progression:** Complete levels by achieving a minimum gold value within a time limit. Each level increases in difficulty with more obstacles and tighter time constraints.\n- **Real-time Updates:** Clear and informative updates on claw position, objects collected, and current scores.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Dependencies\n\nThis game requires no external dependencies. However, ensure your Python environment is correctly set up.\n\nYou can verify your Python installation by running:\n\n```bash\npython --version\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcc2 Project Structure\n\n```\nGoldMinerGame/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 claw.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 game.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 gameobject.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 level.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt\n```\n\n---\n\n## \u25b6\ufe0f How to Play\n\n### Step 1: Run the Game\n\nNavigate to the project directory and execute the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\npython main.py\n```\n\n### Step 2: Gameplay Mechanics\n\n- The claw moves automatically from left to right and vice versa.\n- When the claw is close enough to an object, it automatically grabs and reels it in.\n- Each object has:\n  - **Value:** Amount of gold earned when collected.\n  - **Weight:** Determines how long it takes to reel in.\n- The level ends when:\n  - You collect enough gold to meet the level's requirement, or\n  - The time limit expires.\n\n### Step 3: Level Progression\n\n- Successfully meeting the gold requirement advances you to the next level.\n- Each new level introduces:\n  - More obstacles (rocks).\n  - Higher gold requirements.\n  - Shorter time limits.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Game Objective\n\n- Collect as much gold and diamonds as possible.\n- Avoid grabbing rocks, as they waste valuable time and yield no gold.\n- Progress through levels by meeting or exceeding the gold requirement within the given time limit.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd79\ufe0f Controls and Gameplay Tips\n\n- **Automatic Movement:** The claw moves automatically; your main task is timing and strategy.\n- **Timing is Key:** Pay attention to the claw's position and the objects' locations to maximize your gold collection.\n- **Prioritize Valuable Objects:** Diamonds and larger gold nuggets are more valuable but may take longer to reel in. Balance your strategy accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb Example Gameplay Output\n\n```\nWelcome to Gold Miner!\n\nStarting Level 1\nObjects generated for this level:\nGold at position 3, value: 20, weight: 1.50\nRock at position 7, value: 3, weight: 3.20\nDiamond at position 5, value: 50, weight: 0.80\n...\n\nClaw position: 2\nNo object within grabbing range.\nClaw position: 3\nAutomatically grabbing Gold (value: 20, weight: 1.50)\nReeling in Gold...\nCollected Gold worth 20 gold. Level gold: 20, Total gold: 20\n...\nLevel 1 completed!\n\nStarting Level 2\n...\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udece\ufe0f Support and Feedback\n\nEncountered an issue or have suggestions?

Can you crack the hidden code?\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 Overview\n\nMastermind is a classic puzzle game where the computer selects a hidden sequence of digits, and your goal is to guess this sequence within a limited number of attempts. After each guess, you'll receive feedback indicating:\n\n- \u2705 **Exact Matches**: Number of digits that are correct and in the correct position.\n- \ud83d\udd04 **Partial Matches**: Number of digits that are correct but in the wrong position.\n\nUse this feedback to refine your guesses and crack the code!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Features\n\n- Randomly generated hidden code for each new game.\n- Customizable code length, digit range, and number of attempts.\n- Clear feedback after each guess to guide your next move.\n- User-friendly interface with clear win/lose outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Dependencies\n\nThis project does not require any external dependencies. However, ensure your Python environment is properly set up.\n\nYou can verify your Python installation by running:\n\n```bash\npython --version\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfae How to Play\n\n### Step 1: Download the Game Files\n\nEnsure you have the following files in the same directory:\n\n- `main.py`\n- `game.py`\n\n### Step 2: Run the Game\n\nOpen your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the game files, and execute:\n\n```bash\npython main.py\n```\n\n### Step 3: Gameplay Instructions\n\n- The computer will select a hidden sequence of digits (default length is 4 digits, each digit ranging from 0 to 5).\n- You have a limited number of attempts (default is 10) to guess the correct sequence.\n- Enter your guess as a sequence of digits (e.g., `1234`) and press Enter.\n- After each guess, you'll receive feedback:\n  - \u2705 **Exact Matches**: Correct digit in the correct position.\n  - \ud83d\udd04 **Partial Matches**: Correct digit but in the wrong position.\n- Continue guessing based on the feedback until you either crack the code or run out of attempts.\n\n### Example Gameplay:\n\n```\n\ud83c\udfb2 Welcome to Mastermind! \ud83c\udfb2\n\n\ud83d\udd12 I have selected a hidden sequence of 4 digits (0-5).\nYou have 10 attempts to guess it correctly. Good luck! \ud83c\udf40\n\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess (e.g., 1234): 1234\n\u2705 Exact matches (correct digit and position): 1\n\ud83d\udd04 Partial matches (correct digit, wrong position): 2\n\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess (e.g., 1234): 1243\n\u2705 Exact matches (correct digit and position): 2\n\ud83d\udd04 Partial matches (correct digit, wrong position): 1\n\n...\n\n\ud83c\udf89 Congratulations! You've cracked the code '1423' in 5 attempts! \ud83c\udf89\n```\n\n---\n\n## \u2699\ufe0f Customizing the Game (Optional)\n\nYou can customize the game parameters by editing the `main.py` file:\n\n- `code_length`: Number of digits in the hidden code.\n- `max_attempts`: Maximum number of guesses allowed.\n- `digit_range`: Range of digits (0 to digit_range - 1).\n\nExample:\n\n```python\ncode_length = 6\nmax_attempts = 12\ndigit_range = 8  # Digits from 0 to 7\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc Troubleshooting\n\n- **Invalid Input**: Ensure your guess matches the required length and digit range. The game will prompt you if your input is invalid.\n- **Python Errors**: Verify that both `main.py` and `game.py` are in the same directory and that you are running the command from the correct location.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcde Support\n\nIf you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please contact our support team. We are here to help!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Enjoy the Game!\n\nWe hope you enjoy playing Mastermind and sharpening your logical thinking skills. Good luck cracking the code! \ud83c\udf40\ud83c\udfb2\n```",

This tool efficiently handles basic punctuation and counts sequences of alphanumeric characters as words, providing a quick and easy way to analyze text files.\n\n## Quick Install\n\nTo get started with the Word Count CLI Tool, you need to have Python installed on your system. The tool is compatible with Python version 3.6 and above.\n\n### Step 1: Clone the Repository\n\nFirst, clone the repository to your local machine:\n\n```bash\ngit clone <repository-url>\ncd <repository-directory>\n```\n\n### Step 2: Install Dependencies\n\nEnsure you have the required Python version and install any dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file. You can do this using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n## \ud83e\udd14 What is this?\n\nThe Word Count CLI Tool is designed to provide a straightforward way to count words in a text file. It is particularly useful for developers, writers, and anyone who needs to quickly analyze the word count of their documents.\n\n### Main Functions\n\n- **Word Counting**: Counts the total number of words in a text file, treating sequences of alphanumeric characters as words.\n- **Punctuation Handling**: Ignores basic punctuation to ensure accurate word counts.\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 How to Use\n\n### Running the Tool\n\nTo use the Word Count CLI Tool, navigate to the directory where the tool is located and run the following command:\n\n```bash\npython main.py <file_path>\n```\n\nReplace `<file_path>` with the path to the text file you want to analyze. For example:\n\n```bash\npython main.py example.txt\n```\n\n### Output\n\nThe tool will output the total word count to the console. If the file path is incorrect or an error occurs, an appropriate error message will be displayed.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **Incorrect Usage**: If you do not provide a file path, the tool will display a usage message: `Usage: python main.py <file_path>`.\n- **File Not Found**: Ensure the file path is correct and the file exists.\n- **Encoding Issues**: The tool reads files using UTF-8 encoding. Ensure your text files are encoded in UTF-8 to avoid errors.\n\n## Support\n\nFor further assistance or to report issues, please contact our support team or visit our [GitHub repository](<repository-url>) for more information.\n\n```\n```",

The error traceback indicates a `TclError` with the message \"no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable.\" This error typically occurs when you attempt to run a Tkinter-based GUI application in an environment that does not have access to a graphical display, such as a remote server or a headless environment.\n\nHere are the key points to address the issue:\n\n1. **Environment Issue**: The error suggests that the environment where you are running the application does not have access to a graphical display. This is common when running applications on remote servers without a graphical user interface or when using SSH without X11 forwarding.\n\n2. **Solution Options**:\n   - **Run Locally**: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical display.\n   - **Use X11 Forwarding**: If you need to run the application on a remote server, consider using X11 forwarding with SSH. This allows you to display the GUI on your local machine. You can enable X11 forwarding by using the `-X` or `-Y` option with the `ssh` command (e.g., `ssh -X user@remote-server`).\n   - **Use a Virtual Display**: For environments where a display is not available, you can use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to create a virtual display for the application.\n\n3. **Alternative Approach**: If running the GUI is not feasible, consider using the CLI mode of your application, which does not require a graphical display and can be run in any terminal environment.\n\nBy addressing the environment issue and choosing an appropriate solution, you should be able to run the GUI application without encountering the `TclError`.",

This typically occurs in environments where there is no graphical display available, such as when running the application on a remote server or in a headless environment (e.g., a server without a GUI).\n\n2. **Environment Issue**: The `$DISPLAY` environment variable is not set, which is necessary for GUI applications to know where to render the graphical interface. This variable is usually set automatically in environments with a graphical desktop session.\n\n### Potential Solutions:\n\n- **Run in a GUI Environment**: Ensure that the application is being run in an environment with a graphical display. If you are using a remote server, consider using a tool like VNC or X11 forwarding to provide a display.\n\n- **Use CLI Mode**: If a GUI environment is not available or necessary, you can run the application in CLI mode by using the `--cli` argument when executing the script. This will bypass the GUI and use the command-line interface instead.\n\n- **Set Up a Virtual Display**: For testing purposes in a headless environment, you can use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display.\n\nBy addressing the environment issue or switching to CLI mode, you should be able to resolve the error and run the application successfully.",

This tool allows users to visualize their directory structure up to a specified depth, making it easier to understand and manage file systems.\n\n## Main Functions\n\nThe Directory Tree Generator provides two main interfaces:\n\n1. **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**\n   - Generate a directory tree structure directly from the command line.\n   - Specify the root directory and maximum depth for tree generation.\n\n2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - User-friendly interface using Tkinter for selecting directories and specifying maximum depth.\n   - Visualize the directory tree in a text widget.\n\n## Quick Install\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.\n\n### Installation\n\n1. Clone the repository or download the source code.\n2. Navigate to the project directory.\n3. Install the required Python version (if not already installed).\n\n```bash\n# No external packages are required as the project uses standard libraries\n```\n\n## How to Use\n\n### Using the Command-Line Interface (CLI)\n\n1. Open your terminal or command prompt.\n2. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.\n3. Run the following command to generate a directory tree:\n\n```bash\npython main.py --cli <directory> --max-depth <depth>\n```\n\n- Replace `<directory>` with the path to the directory you want to visualize.\n- Replace `<depth>` with the maximum depth you want to traverse (default is 3).\n\nExample:\n\n```bash\npython main.py --cli /path/to/directory --max-depth 2\n```\n\n### Using the Graphical User Interface (GUI)\n\n1. Run the `main.py` file without any arguments to start the GUI:\n\n```bash\npython main.py\n```\n\n2. In the GUI window:\n   - Click \"Browse\" to select the directory you want to visualize.\n   - Enter the maximum depth in the \"Max Depth\" field.\n   - Click \"Generate Tree\" to display the directory structure.\n\n3. The directory tree will be displayed in the text widget within the GUI.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **Permission Denied:** If you encounter a \"Permission Denied\" message, ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the directory.\n- **Tkinter Errors:** If you face issues with the GUI, ensure your environment supports graphical display or switch to CLI mode.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor further details and updates, please refer to the project repository or contact support.\n\n```",

The user inputs the temperature value, the source unit, and the target unit, and the tool outputs the converted temperature.\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **Convert Temperature:** The tool can convert temperatures between the three units: Celsius (C), Fahrenheit (F), and Kelvin (K). It supports all possible conversions between these units.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- **Python 3.8 or later**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Quick Install\n\nSince there are no external dependencies required for this tool, you only need to ensure Python is installed. Follow these steps to set up the environment:\n\n1. **Clone the Repository:**\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   cd <repository-directory>\n   ```\n\n2. **Run the Tool:**\n   You can directly run the tool using Python:\n   ```bash\n   python main.py <value> <from_unit> <to_unit>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<value>`, `<from_unit>`, and `<to_unit>` with the desired temperature value and units.\n\n## How to Use\n\n### Command-Line Usage\n\nTo use the tool, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located. Use the following command format:\n\n```bash\npython main.py <value> <from_unit> <to_unit>\n```\n\n- `<value>`: The temperature value you want to convert (e.g., 100).\n- `<from_unit>`: The unit of the input temperature. Choose from 'C', 'F', or 'K'.\n- `<to_unit>`: The unit you want to convert the temperature to. Choose from 'C', 'F', or 'K'.\n\n### Example\n\nTo convert 100 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit, use the following command:\n\n```bash\npython main.py 100 C F\n```\n\nThe output will display the converted temperature:\n\n```\nConverted temperature: 212.00 F\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n\nIf you input invalid units or values, the tool will display an error message. Ensure that you use valid units ('C', 'F', 'K') and a numerical value for the temperature.\n\n## Support\n\nFor any issues or questions, please contact our support team or refer to the documentation provided in this manual.\n\n```\n```",

However, if a GUI is required, we can consider using a framework like Tkinter. For now, let's focus on the CLI aspect.\n\n### Core Components\n\n1. **`main.py`**: This will be the entry point of the application. It will handle command-line arguments and invoke the necessary functions to read and format the JSON file.\n\n2. **`json_formatter.py`**: This module will contain the logic to read a JSON file and format it into a human-readable string.\n\n### File: `main.py`\n\nThis file will handle command-line input and call the appropriate functions to process the JSON file.\n\n```python\n'''\n\nmain.py\n\n'''\n\nimport sys\nfrom json_formatter import format_json_file\n\ndef main():\n    '''\n    Main function to handle command-line input and output formatted JSON.\n    '''\n    if len(sys.argv) != 2:\n        print(\"Usage: python main.py <path_to_json_file>\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    file_path = sys.argv[1]\n    try:\n        formatted_json = format_json_file(file_path)\n        print(formatted_json)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### File: `json_formatter.py`\n\nThis module will contain the logic to read a JSON file and format it.\n\n```python\n'''\n\njson_formatter.py\n\n'''\n\nimport json\n\ndef format_json_file(file_path):\n    '''\n    Reads a JSON file and returns its contents in a formatted, human-readable string.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    file_path (str): The path to the JSON file.\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: The formatted JSON string.\n    '''\n    try:\n        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n            data = json.load(file)\n        return json.dumps(data, indent=4)\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        raise Exception(f\"The file at {file_path} was not found.\")\n    except json.JSONDecodeError:\n        raise Exception(\"The file is not a valid JSON.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`main.py`**: This file is responsible for handling command-line arguments. It checks if the correct number of arguments is provided, reads the file path, and calls the `format_json_file` function from `json_formatter.py`. If any error occurs, it prints an error message and exits.\n\n- **`json_formatter.py`**: This module contains the `format_json_file` function, which reads the JSON file, parses it, and returns a formatted string using `json.dumps` with an indentation of 4 spaces. It handles file not found and JSON decoding errors.\n\nThis setup provides a simple CLI tool to format JSON files. If a GUI is required later, we can expand this by integrating a GUI framework like Tkinter.",

    "content": "# JSON Formatter CLI Application\n\nThis user manual provides detailed instructions on how to use the JSON Formatter CLI Application, a tool designed to display the contents of a JSON file in a human-readable, indented format. This application is implemented in Python and can be executed from the command line.\n\n## Main Functions\n\nThe JSON Formatter CLI Application offers the following main functions:\n\n- **Format JSON Files**: Reads a JSON file from a specified file path and outputs its contents in a formatted, human-readable string with indentation for better readability.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore you can use the JSON Formatter CLI Application, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:\n\n- **Python 3.x**: The application is written in Python, so you need Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Quick Install\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository containing the application code to your local machine.\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   ```\n\n2. **Navigate to the Application Directory**: Change your current directory to the directory where the application code is located.\n\n   ```bash\n   cd <repository-directory>\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Dependencies**: The application does not have any external dependencies beyond Python's standard library, so no additional installations are required.\n\n## How to Use\n\n### Running the Application\n\nTo use the JSON Formatter CLI Application, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Open a Terminal**: Access your command-line interface (CLI) on your operating system.\n\n2. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` script with the path to the JSON file you wish to format. Use the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py <path_to_json_file>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<path_to_json_file>` with the actual path to your JSON file.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nSuppose you have a JSON file located at `/path/to/your/file.json`. To format this file, you would run:\n\n```bash\npython main.py /path/to/your/file.json\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n\n- If the file path is incorrect or the file does not exist, the application will display an error message indicating that the file was not found.\n- If the file is not a valid JSON, the application will notify you with an appropriate error message.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor further details on the application, please refer to the source code comments and docstrings within the `main.py` and `json_formatter.py` files. These provide additional insights into the implementation and functionality of the application.\n\n## Support\n\nIf you encounter any issues or have questions about the application, please contact our support team at [support@chatdev.com](mailto:support@chatdev.com).\n\n---\n\nThank you for using the JSON Formatter CLI Application. We hope it meets your needs for formatting JSON files efficiently and effectively.",

Here's a breakdown of the core components:\n\n### Core Components\n\n1. **TaskScheduler**: \n   - **Purpose**: Manage tasks, schedule them, and execute commands at specified times.\n   - **Methods**:\n     - `add_task(date, time, command)`: Add a new task.\n     - `load_tasks()`: Load tasks from a text file.\n     - `save_tasks()`: Save tasks to a text file.\n     - `execute_task(command)`: Execute the specified command.\n\n2. **Task**:\n   - **Purpose**: Represent a single task with a date, time, and command.\n   - **Attributes**: `date`, `time`, `command`.\n\n3. **GUI**:\n   - **Purpose**: Provide a graphical interface for users to interact with the task scheduler.\n   - **Components**:\n     - Entry fields for date, time, and command.\n     - Buttons to add tasks and view scheduled tasks.\n\n### File Structure\n\n1. `main.py`: The main entry point for the application.\n2. `scheduler.py`: Contains the `TaskScheduler` and `Task` classes.\n3. `gui.py`: Contains the GUI implementation using `tkinter`.\n\nLet's start with the implementation:\n\n#### main.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nMain entry point for the CLI Task Scheduler application.\n\n'''\n\nfrom gui import TaskSchedulerGUI\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app = TaskSchedulerGUI()\n    app.run()\n```\n\n#### scheduler.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nContains the TaskScheduler and Task classes for managing and executing tasks.\n\n'''\n\nimport sched\nimport time\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nclass Task:\n    def __init__(self, date, time, command):\n        self.date = date\n        self.time = time\n        self.command = command\n\nclass TaskScheduler:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.scheduler = sched.scheduler(time.time, time.sleep)\n        self.tasks = []\n        self.load_tasks()\n\n    def add_task(self, date, time_str, command):\n        task_time = datetime.strptime(f\"{date} {time_str}\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\")\n        delay = (task_time - datetime.now()).total_seconds()\n        if delay > 0:\n            self.scheduler.enter(delay, 1, self.execute_task, (command,))\n            task = Task(date, time_str, command)\n            self.tasks.append(task)\n            self.save_tasks()\n\n    def load_tasks(self):\n        try:\n            with open(\"tasks.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n                for line in file:\n                    date, time_str, command = line.strip().split(',')\n                    self.add_task(date, time_str, command)\n        except FileNotFoundError:\n            pass\n\n    def save_tasks(self):\n        with open(\"tasks.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n            for task in self.tasks:\n                file.write(f\"{task.date},{task.time},{task.command}\\n\")\n\n    def execute_task(self, command):\n        print(f\"Executing: {command}\")\n        # Here you can use subprocess to execute the command\n        # subprocess.run(command, shell=True)\n\n    def run(self):\n        self.scheduler.run(blocking=True)\n```\n\n#### gui.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nImplements the GUI for the Task Scheduler using tkinter.\n\n'''\n\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom tkinter import messagebox\nfrom scheduler import TaskScheduler\n\nclass TaskSchedulerGUI:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.scheduler = TaskScheduler()\n        self.root = tk.Tk()\n        self.root.title(\"Task Scheduler\")\n\n        self.date_label = tk.Label(self.root, text=\"Date (YYYY-MM-DD):\")\n        self.date_label.pack()\n        self.date_entry = tk.Entry(self.root)\n        self.date_entry.pack()\n\n        self.time_label = tk.Label(self.root, text=\"Time (HH:MM):\")\n        self.time_label.pack()\n        self.time_entry = tk.Entry(self.root)\n        self.time_entry.pack()\n\n        self.command_label = tk.Label(self.root, text=\"Command:\")\n        self.command_label.pack()\n        self.command_entry = tk.Entry(self.root)\n        self.command_entry.pack()\n\n        self.add_button = tk.Button(self.root, text=\"Add Task\", command=self.add_task)\n        self.add_button.pack()\n\n    def add_task(self):\n        date = self.date_entry.get()\n        time_str = self.time_entry.get()\n        command = self.command_entry.get()\n        if date and time_str and command:\n            self.scheduler.add_task(date, time_str, command)\n            messagebox.showinfo(\"Success\", \"Task added successfully!\")\n        else:\n            messagebox.showwarning(\"Input Error\", \"Please fill all fields.\")\n\n    def run(self):\n        self.root.mainloop()\n```\n\nThis implementation provides a basic CLI task scheduler with a GUI using `tkinter`.

    "content": "# Task Scheduler CLI and GUI Application\n\nWelcome to the Task Scheduler CLI and GUI application! This software allows users to schedule tasks to be executed at a specific time and date. The tasks are stored in a simple text file for persistence. This manual will guide you through the main functions of the software, how to install it, and how to use it effectively.\n\n## Main Functions\n\nThe Task Scheduler application provides the following main functions:\n\n1. **Add Task**: Users can add tasks specifying the date, time, and command to be executed.\n2. **Execute Command**: The application will automatically execute the specified command at the scheduled time.\n3. **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in a text file (`tasks.txt`) to ensure they are not lost between sessions.\n4. **CLI Interface**: A command-line interface for users who prefer terminal-based interaction.\n5. **GUI Interface**: A graphical user interface built with Tkinter for users who prefer a visual interaction.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.x must be installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Quick Install\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   ```\n\n2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your directory to the project folder:\n   ```bash\n   cd <project-directory>\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Dependencies**: There are no external dependencies required for this project, as specified in the `requirements.txt` file. However, ensure that Python's standard libraries are available.\n\n## Usage\n\n### CLI Interface\n\n1. **Run the Application**: Execute the following command in your terminal to start the CLI application:\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Add a Task**: Follow the on-screen instructions to add a task. You will be prompted to enter the date (YYYY-MM-DD), time (HH:MM), and the command to be executed.\n\n3. **Exit the Application**: Choose the option to exit when you are done adding tasks.\n\n### GUI Interface\n\n1. **Run the GUI Application**: Execute the following command in your terminal to start the GUI application:\n   ```bash\n   python gui.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Add a Task**: Enter the date, time, and command in the respective fields and click the \"Add Task\" button. A message box will confirm the successful addition of the task.\n\n3. **Close the Application**: Simply close the window when you are finished.\n\n## Additional Information\n\n- **Task Execution**: The application uses Python's `sched` module to schedule tasks and `subprocess` to execute commands.\n- **Task Storage**: Tasks are stored in a `tasks.txt` file in the format `date,time,command`.\n- **Threading**: The scheduler runs in a separate thread to allow continuous interaction with the user interface.\n\nWe hope this manual helps you effectively use the Task Scheduler application. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, please feel free to reach out for support.",

    "content": "# File Encryptor CLI Utility\n\nA command-line interface (CLI) utility for simple file encryption and decryption using a symmetric algorithm (AES) with a user-provided password.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe File Encryptor CLI Utility is designed to provide users with a straightforward method to encrypt and decrypt files using the AES encryption algorithm. This tool ensures that your sensitive data remains secure and accessible only to those with the correct password.\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **Encrypt Files**: Secure your files by encrypting them with a password.\n- **Decrypt Files**: Access your encrypted files by decrypting them with the same password used for encryption.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Environment Setup\n\nTo use the File Encryptor CLI Utility, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need to install the required dependencies.\n\n### Install Dependencies\n\n1. **Using pip**: \n   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary Python package:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pycryptodome==3.18.0\n   ```\n\n2. **Using requirements.txt**:\n   Alternatively, you can install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Command-Line Interface\n\nThe CLI utility can be used to encrypt or decrypt files by providing the necessary arguments.\n\n#### Basic Command Structure\n\n```bash\npython main.py <mode> <input_file> <output_file> <password>\n```\n\n- `<mode>`: Specify `encrypt` to encrypt a file or `decrypt` to decrypt a file.\n- `<input_file>`: Path to the input file you want to encrypt or decrypt.\n- `<output_file>`: Path where the output file will be saved.\n- `<password>`: Password used for encryption or decryption. Ensure it meets the password requirements.\n\n#### Example Commands\n\n- **Encrypt a File**:\n\n  ```bash\n  python main.py encrypt path/to/input.txt path/to/encrypted_output.txt YourPassword123!\n  ```\n\n- **Decrypt a File**:\n\n  ```bash\n  python main.py decrypt path/to/encrypted_output.txt path/to/decrypted_output.txt YourPassword123!\n  ```\n\n### Password Requirements\n\nTo ensure security, the password must meet the following criteria:\n\n- At least 8 characters long\n- Contains at least one digit\n- Contains at least one uppercase letter\n- Contains at least one lowercase letter\n- Contains at least one special character (e.g., `!@#$%^&*()-_+=`)\n\n## Graphical User Interface (Optional)\n\nFor users who prefer a graphical interface, a simple GUI is available. To use the GUI, run the following command:\n\n```bash\npython gui.py\n```\n\nThe GUI allows you to select files for encryption or decryption, input your password, and perform the desired operation with ease.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe File Encryptor CLI Utility is a powerful yet simple tool for securing your files. By following the instructions above, you can easily encrypt and decrypt files to protect your sensitive information. Always remember to use a strong password to ensure the security of your data.",

You can check your Python version with:\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies using pip.\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n## How to Use\n\n1. **Prepare the Configuration File**: Ensure the `config.json` file is present in the same directory as the application. This file contains the exchange rates:\n   ```json\n   {\n       \"USD\": 1.0,\n       \"EUR\": 0.85,\n       \"JPY\": 110.0,\n       \"GBP\": 0.75,\n       \"AUD\": 1.35\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` script to start the currency converter.\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n3. **Input Details**: Follow the prompts to input the amount, source currency, and target currency. The application will output the converted amount.\n\n   Example interaction:\n   ```\n   Enter amount: 100\n   Enter source currency: USD\n   Enter target currency: EUR\n   Converted amount: 85.00 EUR\n   ```\n\n## Error Handling\n\n- **Invalid Amount**: If a non-numeric value is entered for the amount, the application will display an error message.\n- **Unsupported Currency**: If the source or target currency is not supported (i.e., not listed in `config.json`), an error message will be shown.\n- **Configuration File Issues**: If the `config.json` file is missing or contains invalid JSON, the application will alert the user.\n\n## Extending the Application\n\nTo add more currencies or update exchange rates, simply modify the `config.json` file with the new rates. Ensure the rates are relative to USD for consistency.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor further details on the application's architecture and code, please refer to the source code comments in `main.py` and `converter.py`.\n\n```",

Each execution of the tool will show a different quote, providing inspiration or entertainment at the command line.\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **Load Quotes**: The tool reads quotes from a specified text file, ensuring that each line in the file is treated as a separate quote.\n- **Display Random Quote**: Once the quotes are loaded, the tool randomly selects and displays one quote each time it is executed.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Environment Setup\n\nThis project does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Quick Install\n\nClone the repository to your local machine:\n\n```bash\ngit clone <repository-url>\ncd <repository-directory>\n```\n\nNo additional installation steps are required since there are no external dependencies.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Running the Application\n\nTo use the Quote Display CLI Tool, follow these steps:\n\n1. Prepare a text file containing your quotes. Each quote should be on a separate line.\n\n2. Open your terminal or command prompt.\n\n3. Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.\n\n4. Run the application using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py <path_to_quotes_file>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<path_to_quotes_file>` with the path to your text file containing quotes.\n\n### Example\n\nAssuming you have a file named `quotes.txt` in the same directory as `main.py`, you would run:\n\n```bash\npython main.py quotes.txt\n```\n\nThis command will display a random quote from the `quotes.txt` file.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **File Not Found Error**: If you encounter an error stating that the file was not found, ensure that the file path you provided is correct and that the file exists.\n\n- **No Quotes Available**: If the tool displays \"No quotes available,\" check that your quotes file is not empty and that each quote is on a separate line.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Quote Display CLI Tool is a simple yet effective way to bring a bit of randomness and inspiration to your command line. Feel free to modify the quotes file to suit your preferences and enjoy the variety of quotes each time you run the tool.",

    "content": "# URL Shortener CLI\n\nA command-line interface (CLI) tool for shortening URLs using the TinyURL API.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe URL Shortener CLI is a simple and efficient tool designed to shorten long URLs into more manageable links using the TinyURL API. This tool is particularly useful for developers and users who frequently need to share URLs in a concise format.\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **Shorten URL**: The primary function of this CLI tool is to take a long URL provided by the user and return a shortened version using the TinyURL service.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.6 or higher\n- pip (Python package installer)\n\n### Quick Install\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**\n\n   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   cd <repository-directory>\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Dependencies**\n\n   Install the required Python packages using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. **Set Up Environment Variables**\n\n   The CLI tool requires a TinyURL API key to function. Set the `TINYURL_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key:\n\n   ```bash\n   export TINYURL_API_KEY='your_tinyurl_api_key'\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file in the project directory and add the following line:\n\n   ```\n   TINYURL_API_KEY=your_tinyurl_api_key\n   ```\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce you have installed the dependencies and set up the environment variables, you can use the CLI tool to shorten URLs.\n\n### Command-Line Usage\n\nTo shorten a URL, run the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\npython main.py <long_url>\n```\n\nReplace `<long_url>` with the URL you wish to shorten. For example:\n\n```bash\npython main.py https://www.example.com/very/long/url\n```\n\n### Output\n\nThe tool will output the shortened URL if successful. If there is an error (e.g., missing API key, invalid URL), an appropriate error message will be displayed.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **API Key Not Found**: Ensure that the `TINYURL_API_KEY` environment variable is set correctly. You can check this by running `echo $TINYURL_API_KEY` in your terminal.\n\n- **Invalid URL**: Make sure the URL you are trying to shorten is valid and properly formatted.\n\n- **Network Issues**: Ensure that your internet connection is active and stable.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more detailed documentation and examples, please refer to the source code comments and the README file in the repository.\n\n## Support\n\nFor further assistance, please contact our support team or open an issue in the repository.\n\n---\n\nThis manual provides a comprehensive guide to installing and using the URL Shortener CLI tool. Follow the instructions carefully to ensure a smooth setup and operation.",

This tool allows users to input a string and specify whether they want to encode or decode it using Base64 encoding.\n\n## Quick Install\n\nTo use this CLI tool, you need to have Python installed on your system. This tool requires Python version 3.6 or higher.\n\n### Installation Steps\n\n1. **Clone the Repository:**\n\n   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.\n\n2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**\n\n   Change your current directory to the project directory:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd <project-directory>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<project-directory>` with the name of the directory where the repository was cloned.\n\n3. **Install Dependencies:**\n\n   Ensure you have the required Python version. You can create a virtual environment and activate it:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   ```\n\n   Then, install the necessary dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n## \ud83e\udd14 What is this?\n\nThis CLI tool is designed to perform Base64 encoding and decoding operations on strings. Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation. This tool is useful for encoding data that needs to be stored and transferred over media that are designed to deal with text.\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 How to Use\n\n### Running the CLI Tool\n\nTo use the tool, navigate to the directory containing `main.py` and run the following command:\n\n```bash\npython main.py <operation> <input_string>\n```\n\n- `<operation>`: Specify the operation you want to perform. Use `encode` to encode the string or `decode` to decode the string.\n- `<input_string>`: The string you want to encode or decode.\n\n### Examples\n\n1. **Encoding a String:**\n\n   To encode the string \"Hello, World!\" using Base64, run:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py encode \"Hello, World!\"\n   ```\n\n   This will output the Base64 encoded string.\n\n2. **Decoding a String:**\n\n   To decode a Base64 encoded string, for example, \"SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\", run:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py decode \"SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\"\n   ```\n\n   This will output the original string.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nIf an error occurs during decoding (e.g., if the input string is not properly Base64 encoded), the tool will output an error message indicating the issue.\n\n## Resources\n\nFor more information on Base64 encoding, you can refer to the [Wikipedia article on Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64).\n\n```",

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.\n\n## \ud83e\udd14 What is this?\n\nThe Password Strength Checker CLI Tool is designed to help users assess the strength of their passwords. It evaluates passwords based on the following criteria:\n\n- Minimum length of 8 characters\n- Inclusion of at least one uppercase letter\n- Inclusion of at least one lowercase letter\n- Inclusion of at least one digit\n- Inclusion of at least one special character\n\nBased on these criteria, the tool assigns a strength score and a corresponding rating, ranging from \"Very Weak\" to \"Very Strong\".\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 How to Use\n\n### Step 1: Clone the Repository\n\nFirst, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:\n\n```bash\ngit clone <repository-url>\n```\n\nReplace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.\n\n### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory\n\nChange your directory to the project folder:\n\n```bash\ncd <project-directory>\n```\n\nReplace `<project-directory>` with the name of the directory where the project is located.\n\n### Step 3: Run the CLI Tool\n\nExecute the main script to start the password strength checker:\n\n```bash\npython main.py\n```\n\n### Step 4: Enter a Password\n\nWhen prompted, enter the password you wish to evaluate. The tool will output the strength score and rating of the password.\n\n### Example\n\n```bash\nEnter Password: MyP@ssw0rd123\nStrength: Very Strong (Score: 5)\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udd27 How it Works\n\nThe tool uses a simple scoring system to evaluate password strength:\n\n- **Score 1**: Password has a minimum length of 8 characters.\n- **Score 2**: Password includes at least one uppercase letter.\n- **Score 3**: Password includes at least one lowercase letter.\n- **Score 4**: Password includes at least one digit.\n- **Score 5**: Password includes at least one special character.\n\nThe final score determines the password's rating:\n\n- **Very Weak**: Score 0-1\n- **Weak**: Score 2\n- **Moderate**: Score 3\n- **Strong**: Score 4\n- **Very Strong**: Score 5\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Documentation\n\nFor more detailed information on the implementation and code structure, please refer to the source code files:\n\n- `main.py`: Contains the main function to run the CLI tool.\n- `password_checker.py`: Contains the `PasswordStrengthChecker` class that evaluates password strength.\n\nFeel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs!\n\n```",

For now, let's focus on the CLI version.\n\n### Core Components\n\n1. **`WebScraper` Class**: \n   - **Purpose**: To encapsulate the functionality of making HTTP requests and parsing the HTML to extract the title.\n   - **Methods**:\n     - `fetch_html(url)`: Makes an HTTP GET request to the given URL and returns the HTML content.\n     - `extract_title(html)`: Parses the HTML content and extracts the title of the web page.\n\n2. **`main()` Function**:\n   - **Purpose**: To serve as the entry point of the application, handling user input and invoking the `WebScraper` class methods.\n\n### File Structure\n\n1. **`web_scraper.py`**: Contains the `WebScraper` class and the `main()` function.\n\nLet's implement the code.\n\n#### web_scraper.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nThis module provides a simple CLI web scraper that takes a URL and extracts and prints the title of the web page.\n\n'''\n\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\nclass WebScraper:\n    '''\n    A class to represent a web scraper for extracting the title of a web page.\n    '''\n\n    def fetch_html(self, url):\n        '''\n        Makes an HTTP GET request to the given URL and returns the HTML content.\n        \n        Parameters:\n            url (str): The URL of the web page to scrape.\n        \n        Returns:\n            str: The HTML content of the web page.\n        '''\n        try:\n            response = requests.get(url)\n            response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an HTTPError for bad responses\n            return response.text\n        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n            print(f\"An error occurred while fetching the URL: {e}\")\n            return None\n\n    def extract_title(self, html):\n        '''\n        Parses the HTML content and extracts the title of the web page.\n        \n        Parameters:\n            html (str): The HTML content of the web page.\n        \n        Returns:\n            str: The title of the web page.\n        '''\n        if html is None:\n            return None\n        soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')\n        title_tag = soup.title\n        return title_tag.string if title_tag else \"No title found\"\n\ndef main():\n    '''\n    The main function to run the CLI web scraper.\n    '''\n    url = input(\"Enter the URL of the web page: \")\n    scraper = WebScraper()\n    html = scraper.fetch_html(url)\n    title = scraper.extract_title(html)\n    if title:\n        print(f\"The title of the web page is: {title}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Failed to extract the title.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`requests.get(url)`**: This function is used to make an HTTP GET request to the specified URL.\n- **`BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')`**: This creates a BeautifulSoup object for parsing the HTML content.\n- **`soup.title`**: This accesses the `<title>` tag in the HTML document.\n- **`main()`**: This function prompts the user for a URL, uses the `WebScraper` class to fetch and parse the HTML, and prints the title.\n\nThis code provides a simple CLI application that meets the customer's requirements. If a GUI is needed in the future, we can expand upon this foundation using a framework like `tkinter`.",

    "content": "# WebScraper CLI Tool\n\nA simple command-line interface (CLI) web scraper that extracts and prints the title of a web page from a given URL. This tool handles basic HTTP requests and is implemented in Python.\n\n## Main Functions\n\nThe WebScraper CLI tool provides the following main functions:\n\n1. **Fetch HTML Content**: Makes an HTTP GET request to the specified URL and retrieves the HTML content of the web page.\n\n2. **Extract Title**: Parses the HTML content to extract and return the title of the web page.\n\n3. **Command-Line Interface**: Allows users to input a URL directly in the terminal and outputs the title of the web page.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo use the WebScraper CLI tool, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.\n\n### Step-by-Step Installation Guide\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository containing the WebScraper CLI tool to your local machine.\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   cd <repository-directory>\n   ```\n\n2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended): Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies.\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Dependencies**: Use pip to install the required Python packages.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n## How to Use\n\nOnce the environment is set up and dependencies are installed, you can use the WebScraper CLI tool to extract the title of a web page.\n\n### Running the WebScraper\n\n1. **Execute the Script**: Run the `main.py` script using Python.\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Input the URL**: When prompted, enter the URL of the web page you want to scrape.\n\n   ```\n   Enter the URL of the web page: https://example.com\n   ```\n\n3. **View the Output**: The tool will output the title of the web page.\n\n   ```\n   The title of the web page is: Example Domain\n   ```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **HTTP Errors**: If you encounter HTTP errors, ensure that the URL is correct and the server is reachable.\n\n- **No Title Found**: If the tool returns \"No title found\", the web page might not have a `<title>` tag, or the HTML structure might be non-standard.\n\n## Additional Information\n\nThis tool is designed for educational purposes and simple web scraping tasks. For more complex scraping needs, consider using more robust frameworks and tools. Always ensure compliance with the terms of service of the websites you scrape.",

Simply clone the repository or download the source files to your local machine.\n\n## How to Use\n\n### Running the Program\n\n1. **Open a Terminal**: Navigate to the directory where the source files (`main.py`, `sort_functions.py`, `file_functions.py`) are located.\n\n2. **Execute the Program**: Use the following command to run the program:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py <input_file> [-o <output_file>] [-r]\n   ```\n\n   - `<input_file>`: The path to the text file you want to sort.\n   - `-o <output_file>` (optional): The path to the output text file where the sorted lines will be saved. If not provided, the sorted lines will be printed to the console.\n   - `-r` (optional): Include this flag to sort the lines in reverse alphabetical order.\n\n### Examples\n\n- **Sort Alphabetically and Print to Console**:\n\n  ```bash\n  python main.py example.txt\n  ```\n\n- **Sort Alphabetically and Save to a File**:\n\n  ```bash\n  python main.py example.txt -o sorted_example.txt\n  ```\n\n- **Sort Reverse-Alphabetically and Print to Console**:\n\n  ```bash\n  python main.py example.txt -r\n  ```\n\n- **Sort Reverse-Alphabetically and Save to a File**:\n\n  ```bash\n  python main.py example.txt -o sorted_example.txt -r\n  ```\n\n## Error Handling\n\nIf an error occurs (e.g., file not found, permission issues), the program will print an error message to the console. Ensure that the file paths are correct and that you have the necessary permissions to read from and write to the specified files.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Text File Line Sorter CLI is a simple yet powerful tool for organizing text data. Whether you need to sort lines alphabetically or in reverse order, this program provides a straightforward solution. Enjoy using the Text File Line Sorter CLI for your text processing needs!",

The game will provide hints to help you guess the correct number.\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **Random Number Generation**: The game generates a random number between 1 and 100 at the start of each game session.\n- **User Interaction**: You will be prompted to guess the number. After each guess, the game will provide feedback:\n  - \"Higher!\" if your guess is too low.\n  - \"Lower!\" if your guess is too high.\n  - \"Congratulations! You've guessed it!\" when you guess the correct number.\n- **Error Handling**: If you enter an invalid input (non-integer), the game will prompt you to enter a valid number.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo play the CLI Number Guessing Game, you need to have Python installed on your system. The game requires Python version 3.6 or higher.\n\n### Step 1: Install Python\n\nIf you haven't already, download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Step 2: Set Up the Environment\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the game files to your local machine.\n\n2. **Navigate to the Game Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the game files are located.\n\n3. **Install Dependencies**: Although this game does not require any external libraries beyond Python's standard library, it's good practice to ensure your environment is set up correctly. You can create a virtual environment and activate it:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   ```\n\n4. **Install Required Python Version**: Ensure you have the correct Python version by checking your current version:\n\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n   If necessary, update your Python version to 3.6 or higher.\n\n## How to Play\n\n1. **Start the Game**: Run the game by executing the `main.py` file in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Make a Guess**: Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your guess.\n\n3. **Receive Feedback**: The game will inform you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.\n\n4. **Continue Guessing**: Keep guessing until you find the correct number.\n\n5. **Win the Game**: Once you guess the correct number, the game will congratulate you, and you can choose to play again by restarting the game.\n\nEnjoy the challenge and have fun guessing!\n\n```",

However, since the task specifies a CLI (Command Line Interface) game, we will not implement a GUI. Instead, we will focus on creating a text-based interface that runs in the terminal.\n\nHere is the plan for the core components of the Hangman game:\n\n1. **main.py**: This will be the entry point of the application. It will handle the game loop and user interactions.\n2. **game.py**: This will contain the `HangmanGame` class, which manages the game state, including the word selection, tracking guesses, and determining win/loss conditions.\n3. **wordlist.py**: This will provide a list of words from which the game can randomly select a word for the player to guess.\n\nLet's start by implementing each file:\n\n### main.py\n\nFILENAME\n\n```python\n'''\n\nThis is the main entry point for the CLI Hangman game.

    "content": "# CLI Unit Converter for Lengths\n\nThis user manual provides detailed instructions on how to use the CLI Unit Converter for lengths. This application allows users to convert length measurements between different units, such as meters, centimeters, inches, and feet.\n\n## Main Functions\n\nThe CLI Unit Converter is designed to perform the following main functions:\n\n- **Convert Lengths**: Convert a numerical value from one unit of length to another. Supported units include meters (m), centimeters (cm), inches (in), and feet (ft).\n\n## Installation\n\n### Environment Setup\n\nThis application is built using Python and does not require any external dependencies. To run the application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Quick Install\n\nSince there are no external dependencies, you do not need to install any additional packages. Simply ensure Python is installed and proceed to run the application.\n\n## How to Use\n\n1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located. Run the application using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Input Values**: The application will prompt you to enter the following:\n\n   - **Value to Convert**: Enter the numerical value you wish to convert.\n   - **Source Unit**: Enter the unit of the value you are converting from. Supported units are `m` (meters), `cm` (centimeters), `in` (inches), and `ft` (feet).\n   - **Target Unit**: Enter the unit you wish to convert the value to. Supported units are `m`, `cm`, `in`, and `ft`.\n\n3. **View Results**: After entering the required inputs, the application will display the converted value in the target unit.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n- **Convert 100 centimeters to inches**:\n\n  ```\n  Enter the value to convert: 100\n  Enter the source unit (m, cm, in, ft): cm\n  Enter the target unit (m, cm, in, ft): in\n  Result: 39.3701 in\n  ```\n\n- **Convert 5 feet to meters**:\n\n  ```\n  Enter the value to convert: 5\n  Enter the source unit (m, cm, in, ft): ft\n  Enter the target unit (m, cm, in, ft): m\n  Result: 1.5240 m\n  ```\n\n## Error Handling\n\n- **Invalid Input**: If you enter a non-numeric value for the conversion, the application will prompt you with \"Invalid input. Please enter a numeric value.\"\n- **Invalid Unit**: If you enter an unsupported unit, the application will raise an error message: \"Invalid unit. Please enter a valid unit (m, cm, in, ft).\"\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe CLI Unit Converter is a simple yet powerful tool for converting lengths between different units. With its straightforward interface and error handling, it provides a seamless user experience for quick and accurate conversions.",

This can be particularly useful for transferring large files over networks, storing them on devices with limited storage capacity, or simply organizing data into smaller segments.\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **File Splitting**: The utility splits a large file into smaller parts based on a specified chunk size in megabytes (MB).\n- **Sequential Naming**: The output parts are named sequentially, ensuring easy identification and reassembly.\n- **Custom Output Directory**: Users can specify the directory where the output parts will be saved.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Environment Setup\n\nThis project does not require any external Python packages beyond the standard library. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Quick Install\n\nClone the repository to your local machine:\n\n```bash\ngit clone <repository-url>\ncd <repository-directory>\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe utility is executed via the command line. Below is the syntax for using the File Splitter CLI Utility:\n\n```bash\npython main.py <file_path> <output_dir> <chunk_size>\n```\n\n- `<file_path>`: Path to the input file you wish to split.\n- `<output_dir>`: Directory where the output parts will be saved.\n- `<chunk_size>`: Size of each chunk in megabytes (MB).\n\n### Example\n\nTo split a file named `largefile.txt` into 10MB chunks and save the parts in a directory named `output_parts`, use the following command:\n\n```bash\npython main.py largefile.txt output_parts 10\n```\n\n### Output\n\nUpon successful execution, the utility will create multiple files in the specified output directory. Each file will be named sequentially, e.g., `largefile.txt_part00`, `largefile.txt_part01`, etc.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nIf an error occurs during execution, the utility will print an error message to the console. Common issues include:\n\n- Incorrect file path or file does not exist.\n- Insufficient permissions to read the input file or write to the output directory.\n- Invalid chunk size (e.g., non-integer or negative values).\n\nEnsure that the input parameters are correct and that you have the necessary permissions to access the specified files and directories.\n\n## Support\n\nFor further assistance, please contact our support team at support@chatdev.com.\n\n```",

This tool is designed to help you seamlessly join multiple file parts, which have been split using a file splitter, back into a single original file. This user manual will guide you through the installation, usage, and main functions of the software.\n\n## Quick Install\n\nThis project does not require any external Python packages, making it simple to set up and use. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n## \ud83e\udd14 What is this?\n\nThe File Joiner CLI Program is a command-line tool that allows users to merge file parts into a single file. This is particularly useful when dealing with large files that have been split into smaller parts for easier storage or transfer. By specifying the first part of the file, the program automatically identifies and joins all related parts in the correct order.\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 Main Functions\n\n- **Join File Parts**: The primary function of this program is to join multiple file parts into a single file. It reads the parts from the specified directory, sorts them, and writes them into a new file named `joined_file`.\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 How to Use\n\n### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment\n\n1. Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can verify this by running `python --version` in your command line interface.\n2. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.\n\n### Step 2: Run the Program\n\n1. Open your command line interface.\n2. Navigate to the directory where the project files are located.\n3. Execute the program by running the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py <first_part_path>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<first_part_path>` with the path to the first part of the file you wish to join.\n\n### Example\n\nIf your file parts are named `example.part1`, `example.part2`, etc., and are located in the directory `/path/to/files/`, you would run:\n\n```bash\npython main.py /path/to/files/example.part1\n```\n\n### Output\n\nOnce the program completes, you will see a message indicating that the files have been joined successfully. The resulting file will be named `joined_file` and located in the same directory as the file parts.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **Incorrect Usage**: If you do not provide the correct number of arguments, the program will display a usage message and exit.\n- **File Not Found**: Ensure that the path to the first part is correct and that all parts are in the same directory.\n\nThank you for using the File Joiner CLI Program! If you encounter any issues or have questions, please feel free to reach out for support.\n```",

You can install the required dependencies using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nEnsure you have the following dependencies in your `requirements.txt` file:\n\n```\nargparse\n```\n\n## Main Functions\n\n### 1. Rotate Logs\n\nThe primary function of the Log Rotator is to rename an existing log file (e.g., `app.log` to `app.log.1`) and create a new empty `app.log`.\n\n### 2. Compress Logs\n\nOptionally compress rotated log files to save disk space. This feature can be enabled using the `--compress` flag.\n\n### 3. Delete Old Logs\n\nAutomatically delete log files older than a specified number of days. This feature can be configured using the `--delete_days` option.\n\n## How to Use\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nTo run the Log Rotator from the command line, use the following command:\n\n```bash\npython main.py --log_file <log_file> [--compress] [--delete_days <N>]\n```\n\n- `--log_file`: Specify the log file to rotate. Default is `app.log`.\n- `--compress`: Add this flag to compress old logs.\n- `--delete_days <N>`: Specify the number of days after which logs should be deleted.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nRotate `app.log`, compress old logs, and delete logs older than 7 days:\n\n```bash\npython main.py --log_file app.log --compress --delete_days 7\n```\n\n### Graphical User Interface\n\nThe Log Rotator also provides a simple GUI for users who prefer a graphical interface. To run the GUI, execute:\n\n```bash\npython log_rotator_gui.py\n```\n\n- Use the \"Rotate Logs\" button to perform log rotation.\n- Check the \"Compress Logs\" option to enable compression.\n- Enter the number of days in the \"Delete logs older than (days)\" field to set the deletion threshold.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more detailed documentation, please refer to the source code comments and function docstrings. The code is structured to be self-explanatory and easy to navigate.\n\n## Support\n\nFor any issues or questions, please contact our support team or refer to the documentation provided in the source code.\n\n```",

    "content": "The error message you encountered is related to the use of the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python. The specific error is:\n\n```\n_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable\n```\n\nThis error typically occurs when you try to run a Tkinter-based GUI application in an environment that does not have access to a graphical display. This is common when running Python scripts on a server or in a headless environment (e.g., a remote server without a graphical interface).\n\n### Summary of the Problem:\n1. **Environment Issue**: The error indicates that the Tkinter library is unable to find a display to render the GUI. This is because the `$DISPLAY` environment variable, which specifies the display server, is not set. This usually happens in environments without a graphical user interface, such as remote servers or headless setups.\n\n2. **Tkinter Dependency**: The application relies on Tkinter to create and manage the GUI. If the environment does not support GUI operations, the application will fail to initialize the Tkinter root window.\n\n### Solutions:\n1. **Run Locally**: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical interface where Tkinter can access the display server.\n\n2. **Use a Virtual Display**: If you need to run the application on a server, consider using a virtual display server like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to simulate a display environment. You can start Xvfb before running your script to provide a display for Tkinter.\n\n3. **Modify the Application**: If running a GUI is not feasible, consider modifying the application to support a command-line interface (CLI) for environments without a display.\n\nBy addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run the application without encountering the TclError.",

This typically happens when you try to run a Tkinter application on a system without a graphical environment, such as a headless server or a remote terminal session without X11 forwarding.\n\nHere are the key points to address the issue:\n\n1. **Environment Issue**: The error suggests that the Python script is being executed in an environment where there is no graphical display available. This is common when running scripts on a server or through SSH without X11 forwarding.\n\n2. **Solution Options**:\n   - **Run Locally**: If possible, run the script on a local machine with a graphical user interface where Tkinter can open windows.\n   - **X11 Forwarding**: If you need to run the script on a remote server, ensure that X11 forwarding is enabled. This can be done by using the `-X` or `-Y` option with SSH (e.g., `ssh -X user@host`) and ensuring that the server has X11 forwarding enabled in its SSH configuration.\n   - **Virtual Display**: Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to create a virtual display environment where the Tkinter application can render its GUI.\n\n3. **Alternative Approach**: If running the GUI is not essential, consider modifying the application to run in a non-GUI mode, especially for environments where a graphical display is not available.\n\nBy addressing the environment setup, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully run the Tkinter-based application.",

This helps in diagnosing and handling the error when the script is run in a non-GUI environment.",

This application ensures that new or modified files in the source directory are copied to the target directory without deleting any files from the target.\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **One-Way Synchronization**: Copies new or modified files from the source directory to the target directory. It does not delete files from the target directory if they are removed from the source.\n- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for selecting source and target directories and initiating the synchronization process.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- **Python 3.6 or higher**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Environment Setup\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine.\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   cd <repository-directory>\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies using pip.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that your Python version is 3.6 or higher as specified in the `requirements.txt`.\n\n## How to Use\n\n1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script to start the application.\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Select Directories**:\n   - Click on \"Select Source Directory\" to choose the directory from which files will be synchronized.\n   - Click on \"Select Target Directory\" to choose the directory where files will be copied.\n\n3. **Synchronize**:\n   - After selecting both directories, click on the \"Synchronize\" button to start the synchronization process.\n   - A message box will confirm the completion of the synchronization.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **Tkinter Errors**: If you encounter errors related to Tkinter, ensure that you have a display environment set up. For remote servers, consider using X11 forwarding.\n- **Permission Issues**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read from the source directory and write to the target directory.\n\n## Additional Information\n\nFor further assistance or to report issues, please contact our support team or visit our [GitHub repository](<repository-url>) for more information.\n\n```",

    "content": "The error message you encountered is related to the use of the Tkinter library in a non-GUI environment. The specific error, `_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable`, indicates that the script is trying to create a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, but it cannot find a display to render the GUI on. This typically happens when the script is executed in an environment without a graphical display, such as a remote server or a headless setup.\n\nHere are the key points to address this issue:\n\n1. **Environment Issue**: The error suggests that the script is being run in an environment where there is no graphical display available. This is common in headless environments or when running scripts over SSH without X11 forwarding.\n\n2. **Solution Options**:\n   - **Run in a GUI Environment**: If you intend to use the Tkinter-based GUI, ensure that the script is executed in an environment with a graphical display, such as a local machine with a desktop environment.\n   - **Use X11 Forwarding**: If you are running the script over SSH, you can enable X11 forwarding by using the `-X` or `-Y` option with the SSH command, provided the server supports it.\n   - **Modify the Script for CLI**: If a GUI is not necessary, consider modifying the script to work as a command-line interface (CLI) tool instead of using Tkinter, which would eliminate the need for a graphical display.\n\n3. **Alternative Approach**: If you decide to convert the application to a CLI tool, you can use command-line arguments to specify source directories and the target backup location, and then generate the scripts accordingly without relying on a GUI.\n\nBy addressing the environment issue or modifying the script to avoid the need for a GUI, you can resolve the error and successfully run the script.",

    "content": "# Backup Script Creator\n\nA simple CLI tool to generate backup scripts using `rsync` or `tar`. This tool allows users to specify source directories and a target backup location, and it generates a shell script for backing up the specified directories.\n\n## Quick Install\n\nNo external dependencies are required for this project. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.\n\n## \ud83e\udd14 What is this?\n\nThe Backup Script Creator is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to simplify the process of creating backup scripts. By specifying the source directories and a target backup location, users can generate a shell script that uses either `rsync` or `tar` for backing up files. This tool is ideal for users who need to automate their backup processes without manually writing scripts.\n\n### Main Functions\n\n- **Generate Backup Script with `rsync`:** Creates a shell script that uses `rsync` to copy files from the source directories to the target backup location.\n- **Generate Backup Script with `tar`:** Creates a shell script that uses `tar` to archive files from the source directories into the target backup location.\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 Documentation\n\n### Getting Started\n\n1. **Clone the Repository:**\n\n   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   cd <repository-directory>\n   ```\n\n2. **Ensure Python is Installed:**\n\n   Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can verify this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the Application:**\n\n   You can run the application directly using the command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py -s <source_directories> -t <target_directory> -m <method> -o <output_file>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<source_directories>`, `<target_directory>`, `<method>`, and `<output_file>` with your desired values.\n\n### How to Use\n\n- **Specify Source Directories:**\n\n  Use the `-s` or `--sources` option to list the directories you want to back up. You can specify multiple directories separated by space.\n\n- **Specify Target Directory:**\n\n  Use the `-t` or `--target` option to specify the directory where the backups will be stored.\n\n- **Choose Backup Method:**\n\n  Use the `-m` or `--method` option to choose between `rsync` and `tar` for the backup method.\n\n- **Specify Output File:**\n\n  Use the `-o` or `--output` option to specify the file where the generated script will be saved.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo create a backup script using `rsync`:\n\n```bash\npython main.py -s /path/to/source1 /path/to/source2 -t /path/to/backup -m rsync -o backup_script.sh\n```\n\nTo create a backup script using `tar`:\n\n```bash\npython main.py -s /path/to/source1 /path/to/source2 -t /path/to/backup -m tar -o backup_script.sh\n```\n\n### Resources\n\nFor more information on `rsync` and `tar`, you can refer to their respective documentation:\n\n- [rsync Documentation](https://rsync.samba.org/documentation.html)\n- [tar Documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/tar.html)\n\nThis tool is designed to be simple and efficient, providing users with a quick way to automate their backup processes.",

    "content": "# Sudoku Solver CLI Application\n\nWelcome to the Sudoku Solver CLI Application! This application allows you to solve any partially filled 9x9 Sudoku grid using a backtracking algorithm. This user manual will guide you through the main functions of the software, how to install it, and how to use it.\n\n## Main Functions\n\nThe Sudoku Solver CLI Application provides the following main functions:\n\n- **Input a Sudoku Grid**: Enter a partially filled 9x9 Sudoku grid directly into the command line interface. Use '0' to represent empty cells.\n- **Solve the Sudoku**: The application uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle.\n- **Output the Solved Grid**: Once solved, the application will print the completed Sudoku grid to the console.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Quick Install\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   ```\n   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.\n\n2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your directory to the project folder:\n   ```bash\n   cd <project-directory>\n   ```\n   Replace `<project-directory>` with the name of the cloned directory.\n\n3. **Install Dependencies**: There are no external dependencies required for this project. However, ensure your Python environment is set up correctly.\n\n## How to Use\n\n1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script to start the application:\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Input the Sudoku Grid**: When prompted, enter the Sudoku grid row by row. Use spaces to separate numbers and '0' for empty cells. Each row should contain exactly 9 numbers.\n\n   Example input:\n   ```\n   5 3 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n   6 0 0 1 9 5 0 0 0\n   0 9 8 0 0 0 0 6 0\n   8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 3\n   4 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 1\n   7 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 6\n   0 6 0 0 0 0 2 8 0\n   0 0 0 4 1 9 0 0 5\n   0 0 0 0 8 0 0 7 9\n   ```\n\n3. **View the Solved Sudoku**: After entering the grid, the application will process the input and display the solved Sudoku grid. If no solution exists, it will notify you accordingly.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **Invalid Input**: Ensure each row contains exactly 9 numbers. Use '0' for empty cells.\n- **No Solution Exists**: If the application states that no solution exists, verify the input grid for any inconsistencies or errors.\n\n## Support\n\nFor further assistance, please contact our support team or visit our documentation page.\n\nThank you for using the Sudoku Solver CLI Application! Enjoy solving your puzzles.",

This application allows users to specify the dimensions of the maze and outputs the maze to the console using '#' for walls and ' ' for paths.\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **Maze Generation**: The application generates a maze using a randomized depth-first search algorithm.\n- **Customizable Dimensions**: Users can specify the width and height of the maze.\n- **Console Output**: The generated maze is displayed in the console as a 2D grid of characters.\n\n## Quick Install\n\nTo run the CLI Maze Generator, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Environment Setup\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the maze generator code to your local machine.\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   ```\n\n2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change your working directory to the location of the cloned repository.\n\n   ```bash\n   cd <repository-directory>\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Dependencies**: The application does not require any external Python packages beyond the standard library, so no additional installations are necessary.\n\n## How to Use\n\n1. **Run the Application**: Use the command line to run the `main.py` script with the desired maze dimensions.\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py <width> <height>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<width>` and `<height>` with the desired dimensions of the maze. Both values should be integers.\n\n2. **Example Usage**:\n\n   To generate a maze with a width of 10 and a height of 5, execute the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py 10 5\n   ```\n\n3. **Output**: The generated maze will be displayed in the console. The maze consists of walls represented by '#' and paths represented by spaces.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **Invalid Input**: If you enter non-integer values for width and height, the application will display an error message: \"Invalid input. Please enter integers for width and height.\"\n\n- **Incorrect Usage**: If you do not provide exactly two arguments for width and height, the application will display the usage instructions: \"Usage: python main.py <width> <height>\".\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more information on the implementation details and algorithm used in the maze generation, please refer to the comments within the source code files `maze_generator.py` and `main.py`.\n\n## Support\n\nFor any issues or questions, please contact our support team at [support@chatdev.com](mailto:support@chatdev.com).\n```",

    "content": "# Docker CLI Manager User Manual\n\nWelcome to the Docker CLI Manager, a command-line interface tool designed to help you manage Docker containers efficiently. This tool allows you to list, start, stop, and view logs of Docker containers using simple commands.\n\n## Main Functions\n\nThe Docker CLI Manager provides the following main functionalities:\n\n1. **List Containers**: View all or only running Docker containers.\n2. **Start Container**: Start a Docker container by specifying its ID or name.\n3. **Stop Container**: Stop a Docker container by specifying its ID or name.\n4. **View Logs**: Display logs of a specific Docker container by ID or name.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Ensure Docker is installed on your system and you have the necessary permissions to manage Docker containers.\n- Python 3.x should be installed on your system.\n\n### Install Environment Dependencies\n\nTo install the required dependencies for the Docker CLI Manager, follow these steps:\n\n1. Clone the repository or download the source code.\n2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code.\n3. Install the required Python packages using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\nThis will install the Docker SDK for Python, which is necessary for interacting with Docker.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Running the CLI\n\nTo use the Docker CLI Manager, open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file. Use the following command format to execute different operations:\n\n```bash\npython main.py <command> [options]\n```\n\n#### Commands\n\n- **List Containers**: To list all running containers, use:\n\n  ```bash\n  python main.py list\n  ```\n\n  To list all containers (including stopped ones), use:\n\n  ```bash\n  python main.py list --all\n  ```\n\n- **Start Container**: To start a container, specify its ID or name:\n\n  ```bash\n  python main.py start <container_id_or_name>\n  ```\n\n- **Stop Container**: To stop a container, specify its ID or name:\n\n  ```bash\n  python main.py stop <container_id_or_name>\n  ```\n\n- **View Logs**: To view logs of a container, specify its ID or name:\n\n  ```bash\n  python main.py logs <container_id_or_name>\n  ```\n\n### Running the GUI\n\nIn addition to the CLI, a graphical user interface (GUI) is available using Tkinter. To launch the GUI, execute the following command:\n\n```bash\npython docker_gui.py\n```\n\nThe GUI provides buttons to list running containers, start/stop containers, and view logs. Simply select a container from the list and click the appropriate button to perform an action.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor further details and advanced usage, please refer to the source code and comments within the files. The `docker_manager.py` file contains the core logic for interacting with Docker, while `docker_gui.py` provides the GUI implementation.\n\nWe hope this tool enhances your Docker container management experience. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please feel free to contribute or reach out to us.",

It allows users to add, list, and remove SSH connection aliases, which include details such as hostname, user, port, and key file. This tool is available both as a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **Add Alias**: Create a new SSH alias with specified details.\n- **List Aliases**: Display all stored SSH aliases.\n- **Remove Alias**: Delete an existing SSH alias by name.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.6 or higher is required.\n- Tkinter library for GUI (usually included with Python, but may need separate installation on some Linux distributions).\n\n### Installing Dependencies\n\n1. **Ensure Python is installed**: Verify that Python 3.6 or higher is installed on your system. You can check this by running:\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Tkinter** (if not already installed):\n   - On Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, run:\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get install python3-tk\n     ```\n   - On Fedora, run:\n     ```bash\n     sudo dnf install python3-tkinter\n     ```\n\n3. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine.\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   cd <repository-directory>\n   ```\n\n4. **Install Python Dependencies**: Install any additional Python dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Command-Line Interface (CLI)\n\n1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Ensure you are in the directory containing the `main.py` file.\n\n2. **Run the Application**: Use the following commands to manage your SSH aliases.\n\n   - **Add an Alias**:\n     ```bash\n     python main.py add --alias <alias_name> --hostname <hostname> --user <user> --port <port> --keyfile <key_file>\n     ```\n     Example:\n     ```bash\n     python main.py add --alias myserver --hostname example.com --user admin --port 22 --keyfile ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n     ```\n\n   - **List Aliases**:\n     ```bash\n     python main.py list\n     ```\n\n   - **Remove an Alias**:\n     ```bash\n     python main.py remove --alias <alias_name>\n     ```\n     Example:\n     ```bash\n     python main.py remove --alias myserver\n     ```\n\n### Graphical User Interface (GUI)\n\n1. **Run the GUI Application**: Execute the following command to launch the GUI.\n   ```bash\n   python ssh_alias_gui.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Using the GUI**:\n   - **Add Alias**: Click the \"Add Alias\" button and fill in the details in the popup window.\n   - **List Aliases**: Click the \"List Aliases\" button to view all stored aliases.\n   - **Remove Alias**: Click the \"Remove Alias\" button and enter the alias name to delete it.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe SSH Alias Manager provides a convenient way to manage SSH connection details, making it easier to connect to remote servers without remembering complex connection strings. Whether you prefer using the command line or a graphical interface, this tool offers flexibility and ease of use.\n\nFor further assistance or to report issues, please contact our support team.\n\n```",

This tool uses the Pillow library to handle image processing tasks.\n\n## Quick Install\n\nTo use the CLI Image Resizer, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nThis command will install the Pillow library, which is necessary for image processing.\n\n## \ud83e\udd14 What is this?\n\nThe CLI Image Resizer is a tool designed to resize images to a specified width or height while maintaining the original aspect ratio. This means that the resized image will not be distorted, preserving the original proportions.\n\n### Main Features\n\n- **Aspect Ratio Maintenance**: Automatically calculates the missing dimension (width or height) to ensure the image's aspect ratio is preserved.\n- **Flexible Input**: Allows users to specify either the target width or height.\n- **Simple CLI Interface**: Easy to use with command-line arguments for specifying input and output paths, as well as the desired dimensions.\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 How to Use\n\n### Command-Line Usage\n\nTo use the CLI Image Resizer, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `main.py`. Use the following command structure:\n\n```bash\npython main.py <input_path> <output_path> --width <target_width> --height <target_height>\n```\n\n- `<input_path>`: Path to the input image file.\n- `<output_path>`: Path where the resized image will be saved.\n- `--width <target_width>`: (Optional) Desired width of the resized image.\n- `--height <target_height>`: (Optional) Desired height of the resized image.\n\n**Note**: You must specify either the `--width` or `--height` argument, but not both. If both are specified, the tool will prioritize the width.\n\n### Example\n\nTo resize an image to a width of 300 pixels while maintaining aspect ratio:\n\n```bash\npython main.py input.jpg output.jpg --width 300\n```\n\nTo resize an image to a height of 200 pixels while maintaining aspect ratio:\n\n```bash\npython main.py input.jpg output.jpg --height 200\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n\nIf neither `--width` nor `--height` is specified, the program will display an error message:\n\n```\nError: Please specify either target width or height.\n```\n\n## Additional Information\n\nFor more information on the Pillow library and its capabilities, please refer to the [Pillow documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n\nThis tool is designed to be simple and efficient, making it easy for users to resize images without needing to understand complex image processing techniques.\n```",

This tool helps ensure that your YAML files are correctly formatted and provides detailed error messages with line numbers if any syntax issues are detected.\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **Validate YAML Syntax**: The primary function of this application is to validate the syntax of a YAML file. It reads the file, checks for any syntax errors, and provides feedback on the validity of the file.\n\n- **Error Reporting**: If the YAML file contains syntax errors, the application will report the error along with the specific line and column number where the error occurred.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo use the YAML Validator CLI application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.\n\n### Step-by-Step Installation\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine.\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   cd <repository-directory>\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Python**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n3. **Install Dependencies**: Use pip to install the required dependencies.\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce the environment is set up, you can use the YAML Validator CLI application to validate YAML files.\n\n### Running the CLI Application\n\n1. **Navigate to the Application Directory**: Ensure you are in the directory where the application files are located.\n\n2. **Run the Application**: Use the following command to run the application and validate a YAML file.\n   ```bash\n   python main.py <path-to-yaml-file>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<path-to-yaml-file>` with the actual path to the YAML file you want to validate.\n\n3. **Interpreting Results**: The application will print a message indicating whether the YAML syntax is valid. If there are errors, it will provide details about the error, including the line and column number.\n\n### Example\n\nTo validate a file located at `config/example.yaml`, you would run:\n```bash\npython main.py config/example.yaml\n```\n\n### GUI Version\n\nFor users who prefer a graphical interface, a GUI version of the YAML Validator is also available. To use the GUI:\n\n1. **Run the GUI Application**: Execute the following command:\n   ```bash\n   python yaml_validator_gui.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Use the Interface**: Use the \"Browse\" button to select a YAML file and click \"Validate\" to check its syntax.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more detailed documentation and examples, please refer to the source code and comments within the files. The code is designed to be straightforward and easy to understand, with comments explaining each function's purpose and usage.\n\n## Support\n\nFor any issues or questions, please contact our support team or open an issue on the repository's issue tracker.\n\n```",

    "content": "# XML Pretty Printer CLI\n\nA command-line interface (CLI) application for formatting XML files into a well-structured, indented format. This tool allows users to output the formatted XML either to the console or save it to a new file.\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **Pretty Print to Console**: Reads an XML file and outputs a well-formatted version to the console.\n- **Pretty Print to File**: Reads an XML file and writes the formatted version to a specified output file.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Environment Dependencies\n\nTo run the XML Pretty Printer CLI, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, the application requires the `lxml` library for XML parsing and formatting.\n\n#### Quick Install\n\nYou can install the required dependencies using `pip`:\n\n```bash\npip install lxml\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `requirements.txt` file to install dependencies:\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Running the Application\n\nThe XML Pretty Printer CLI can be executed from the command line. Below are the instructions on how to use the application:\n\n1. **Pretty Print to Console**\n\n   To format an XML file and print it to the console, use the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py path/to/input.xml\n   ```\n\n   Replace `path/to/input.xml` with the path to your XML file.\n\n2. **Pretty Print to File**\n\n   To format an XML file and save the output to a new file, use the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py path/to/input.xml -o path/to/output.xml\n   ```\n\n   Replace `path/to/input.xml` with the path to your XML file and `path/to/output.xml` with the desired output file path.\n\n### Error Handling\n\n- If the XML file contains syntax errors, the application will output an \"XML Syntax Error\" message.\n- If the specified input file is not found, an error message will indicate that the file was not found.\n- Any other exceptions will be caught and displayed as a general error message.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe XML Pretty Printer CLI is a simple yet powerful tool for developers and users who need to format XML files efficiently. By following the installation and usage instructions, you can easily integrate this tool into your workflow for better XML file management.",

    "content": "The error message you encountered is related to the graphical user interface (GUI) part of the application, specifically when trying to initialize a Tkinter window. The error traceback indicates a `TclError` with the message \"no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable.\" This error typically occurs when you attempt to run a Tkinter-based GUI application on a system that does not have a graphical display environment available, such as a remote server or a headless environment.\n\nHere is a summary of the issue:\n\n1. **Environment Issue**: The error suggests that the environment where the application is being executed does not have access to a graphical display. This is common in headless environments or when running the application over SSH without X11 forwarding.\n\n2. **Tkinter Initialization**: The error occurs at the point where the Tkinter root window is being initialized (`self.root = tk.Tk()`). Tkinter requires a display to create GUI windows, and without a display, it cannot proceed.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you have a few options:\n\n- **Run in CLI Mode**: If a GUI is not necessary, you can run the application in CLI mode by providing command-line arguments. This bypasses the need for a graphical display.\n\n- **Use X11 Forwarding**: If you are running the application over SSH, you can enable X11 forwarding to allow GUI applications to display on your local machine. This requires an X server running on your local machine.\n\n- **Use a Virtual Display**: In a headless environment, you can use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to provide a display for GUI applications.\n\n- **Environment Check**: Modify the application to check for the availability of a display environment before attempting to initialize the GUI. If no display is available, the application can default to CLI mode or provide an appropriate error message.",

    "content": "# HTML Stripper CLI Tool\n\nWelcome to the HTML Stripper CLI Tool! This application is designed to strip all HTML tags from an HTML file or string input, leaving only the plain text content. The tool can be used in both command-line interface (CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI) modes.\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **Strip HTML Tags from a File**: Provide the path to an HTML file, and the tool will output the plain text content.\n- **Strip HTML Tags from a String**: Input an HTML string directly, and the tool will output the plain text content.\n- **Dual Interface**: Use the tool via the command line or through a simple GUI.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Environment Setup\n\nThis project does not require any external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. However, ensure that `tkinter` is available in your Python environment if you wish to use the GUI mode.\n\n### Quick Install\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: \n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   cd <repository-directory>\n   ```\n\n2. **Ensure Python is Installed**: \n   Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n3. **Verify tkinter Availability**: \n   `tkinter` is included with standard Python installations. To verify, run:\n   ```bash\n   python -m tkinter\n   ```\n   If a simple window appears, `tkinter` is installed correctly.\n\n## How to Use\n\n### Command-Line Interface (CLI)\n\n1. **Run the Application**:\n   ```bash\n   python main.py -f <path-to-html-file>\n   ```\n   or\n   ```bash\n   python main.py -s \"<html-string>\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Options**:\n   - `-f`, `--file`: Specify the path to an HTML file.\n   - `-s`, `--string`: Provide an HTML string directly.\n\n3. **Example**:\n   ```bash\n   python main.py -f example.html\n   ```\n   or\n   ```bash\n   python main.py -s \"<p>Hello, <b>world</b>!</p>\"\n   ```\n\n### Graphical User Interface (GUI)\n\n1. **Run the Application**:\n   Simply execute the script without any arguments:\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Using the GUI**:\n   - Enter HTML content in the input text area.\n   - Click the \"Strip HTML\" button.\n   - View the plain text output in the output text area.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **File Not Found**: Ensure the file path is correct when using the `-f` option.\n- **No Display Environment**: If running on a server or a system without a display, use the CLI mode instead of the GUI.\n\n## Support\n\nFor any issues or questions, please contact our support team or visit our [GitHub repository](<repository-url>) for more information and updates.\n\nThank you for using the HTML Stripper CLI Tool! We hope it simplifies your workflow and enhances your productivity.",

By default, it starts with a 25-minute work session followed by a 5-minute break. However, you can configure these durations to suit your needs. The application also provides notifications to alert you when it's time to switch between work and break sessions.\n\n## Quick Install\n\nThis application does not require any external dependencies, making it easy to set up and run. Simply clone the repository and execute the main script.\n\n### Steps to Install\n\n1. **Clone the Repository:**\n\n   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.\n\n2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**\n\n   ```bash\n   cd <repository-directory>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<repository-directory>` with the name of the directory where the repository was cloned.\n\n3. **Run the Application:**\n\n   Execute the following command to start the Pomodoro Timer:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n## How to Use\n\nOnce the application is running, you can interact with it using the following commands:\n\n- **start**: Begin the Pomodoro timer. This will start the countdown for the current session (either work or break).\n\n- **stop**: Pause the timer. This will halt the countdown until you decide to start it again.\n\n- **reset**: Reset the timer. This will reset the current session's countdown to its initial duration.\n\n- **exit**: Exit the application. This will terminate the Pomodoro Timer CLI.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. **Start the Timer:**\n\n   To begin a work session, type `start` and press Enter. The timer will start counting down from the configured work duration.\n\n2. **Stop the Timer:**\n\n   If you need to pause the session, type `stop` and press Enter. The timer will pause until you type `start` again.\n\n3. **Reset the Timer:**\n\n   To reset the current session, type `reset` and press Enter. This will set the timer back to the start of the current session.\n\n4. **Exit the Application:**\n\n   When you are done using the timer, type `exit` and press Enter to close the application.\n\n## Notifications\n\nThe application provides simple notifications in the form of console messages to alert you when a session ends and a new one begins. This helps you stay on track without needing to constantly monitor the timer.\n\n## Customization\n\nYou can customize the work and break durations by modifying the `PomodoroTimer` class in the `pomodoro_timer.py` file. Change the default values of `work_duration` and `break_duration` to your preferred durations in seconds.\n\n```python\nclass PomodoroTimer:\n    def __init__(self, work_duration=25*60, break_duration=5*60):\n        # Customize durations here\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Pomodoro Timer CLI is a straightforward tool to help you manage your time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. With its simple commands and notifications, you can easily integrate it into your daily workflow to enhance productivity.\n```",

    "content": "To create a CLI flashcard study tool with a GUI using Python, we will use the `tkinter` library for the GUI component. The application will allow users to create decks of flashcards, add cards to these decks, and review them. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the core classes and functions needed:\n\n### Core Classes and Functions\n\n1. **FlashcardApp**: Main application class to initialize and run the GUI.\n   - `__init__`: Initialize the main window and set up the layout.\n   - `run`: Start the main loop of the application.\n\n2. **DeckManager**: Manages the creation and storage of decks.\n   - `create_deck`: Create a new deck.\n   - `get_decks`: Retrieve all decks.\n\n3. **FlashcardManager**: Manages flashcards within a deck.\n   - `add_flashcard`: Add a flashcard to a specific deck.\n   - `get_flashcards`: Retrieve all flashcards from a specific deck.\n\n4. **ReviewManager**: Handles the review process of flashcards.\n   - `start_review`: Begin reviewing flashcards from a selected deck.\n   - `next_card`: Show the next flashcard for review.\n\n5. **GUI Components**: Functions to create and manage GUI components.\n   - `create_main_menu`: Set up the main menu interface.\n   - `create_deck_interface`: Interface for creating and managing decks.\n   - `create_flashcard_interface`: Interface for adding flashcards.\n   - `create_review_interface`: Interface for reviewing flashcards.\n\n### File Structure\n\n1. **main.py**: The entry point of the application.\n2. **deck_manager.py**: Handles deck-related operations.\n3. **flashcard_manager.py**: Handles flashcard-related operations.\n4. **review_manager.py**: Handles the review process.\n\nLet's implement the code for each file:\n\n#### main.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nMain application file to run the flashcard study tool.\n\n'''\n\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom deck_manager import DeckManager\nfrom flashcard_manager import FlashcardManager\nfrom review_manager import ReviewManager\n\nclass FlashcardApp:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.root = tk.Tk()\n        self.root.title(\"Flashcard Study Tool\")\n        self.deck_manager = DeckManager()\n        self.flashcard_manager = FlashcardManager()\n        self.review_manager = ReviewManager(self.flashcard_manager)\n        self.create_main_menu()\n\n    def create_main_menu(self):\n        menu_frame = tk.Frame(self.root)\n        menu_frame.pack(pady=20)\n\n        create_deck_button = tk.Button(menu_frame, text=\"Create Deck\", command=self.create_deck_interface)\n        create_deck_button.pack(pady=5)\n\n        add_flashcard_button = tk.Button(menu_frame, text=\"Add Flashcard\", command=self.create_flashcard_interface)\n        add_flashcard_button.pack(pady=5)\n\n        review_flashcards_button = tk.Button(menu_frame, text=\"Review Flashcards\", command=self.create_review_interface)\n        review_flashcards_button.pack(pady=5)\n\n    def create_deck_interface(self):\n        # Implementation for creating a deck interface\n        pass\n\n    def create_flashcard_interface(self):\n        # Implementation for creating a flashcard interface\n        pass\n\n    def create_review_interface(self):\n        # Implementation for creating a review interface\n        pass\n\n    def run(self):\n        self.root.mainloop()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app = FlashcardApp()\n    app.run()\n```\n\n#### deck_manager.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nHandles deck-related operations.\n\n'''\n\nclass DeckManager:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.decks = {}\n\n    def create_deck(self, deck_name):\n        if deck_name not in self.decks:\n            self.decks[deck_name] = []\n            return True\n        return False\n\n    def get_decks(self):\n        return list(self.decks.keys())\n```\n\n#### flashcard_manager.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nHandles flashcard-related operations.\n\n'''\n\nclass FlashcardManager:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.flashcards = {}\n\n    def add_flashcard(self, deck_name, question, answer):\n        if deck_name not in self.flashcards:\n            self.flashcards[deck_name] = []\n        self.flashcards[deck_name].append((question, answer))\n\n    def get_flashcards(self, deck_name):\n        return self.flashcards.get(deck_name, [])\n```\n\n#### review_manager.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nHandles the review process of flashcards.\n\n'''\n\nclass ReviewManager:\n    def __init__(self, flashcard_manager):\n        self.flashcard_manager = flashcard_manager\n        self.current_deck = None\n        self.current_index = 0\n\n    def start_review(self, deck_name):\n        self.current_deck = deck_name\n        self.current_index = 0\n\n    def next_card(self):\n        if self.current_deck is None:\n            return None\n        flashcards = self.flashcard_manager.get_flashcards(self.current_deck)\n        if self.current_index < len(flashcards):\n            card = flashcards[self.current_index]\n            self.current_index += 1\n            return card\n        return None\n```\n\nThis code provides a basic structure for the CLI flashcard study tool with a GUI. The `main.py` file initializes the application and sets up the main menu. The `deck_manager.py`, `flashcard_manager.py`, and `review_manager.py` files handle the core functionalities of managing decks, flashcards, and the review process, respectively. The GUI components are placeholders and need to be implemented to provide the actual interfaces for creating decks, adding flashcards, and reviewing them.",

This tool allows you to send a file from one machine (client) to another (server) running a corresponding receiver script.\n\n## Quick Install\n\nThis project does not require any external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.\n\n## \ud83e\udd14 What is this?\n\nThe CLI File Transfer Tool is designed to facilitate the transfer of files between two machines on the same local network. It consists of two main components:\n\n- **Server**: Listens for incoming connections and receives files from clients.\n- **Client**: Connects to the server and sends files.\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 Documentation\n\n### Main Functions\n\n- **Server**: Starts a server that listens for incoming file transfers.\n- **Client**: Sends a specified file to the server.\n\n### How to Use\n\n1. **Start the Server**\n\n   To start the server, run the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py server --host <host> --port <port>\n   ```\n\n   - `--host`: The host address to bind the server (default is `0.0.0.0`).\n   - `--port`: The port number to bind the server (default is `5001`).\n\n   Example:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5001\n   ```\n\n   This will start the server and it will listen for incoming connections on the specified host and port.\n\n2. **Send a File from the Client**\n\n   To send a file from the client, run the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py client <file_path> --host <server_host> --port <server_port>\n   ```\n\n   - `<file_path>`: The path of the file you want to send.\n   - `--host`: The server host to connect to (default is `localhost`).\n   - `--port`: The server port to connect to (default is `5001`).\n\n   Example:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py client example.txt --host 192.168.1.10 --port 5001\n   ```\n\n   This will send the file `example.txt` to the server running on `192.168.1.10` at port `5001`.\n\n### Additional Information\n\n- Ensure both the client and server are on the same local network for successful file transfer.\n- The server will save received files with a timestamped filename to avoid overwriting existing files.\n\nFor any further assistance or support, please contact our support team.\n```",

You will also need to install the required dependencies.\n\n### Quick Install\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the source code to your local machine.\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   cd <repository-directory>\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Dependencies**: Use pip to install the necessary Python packages.\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n   This will install the `humanize` package, which is used for formatting file sizes in a human-readable format.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use the Disk Space Analyzer, run the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\npython main.py <directory> [-n NUMBER]\n```\n\n- `<directory>`: The directory you want to analyze.\n- `-n NUMBER`: (Optional) The number of largest items to display. Default is 10.\n\n### Example\n\nTo analyze the `/home/user/documents` directory and display the 5 largest items, use:\n\n```bash\npython main.py /home/user/documents -n 5\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more detailed information about the Disk Space Analyzer, please refer to the `readme.md` file included in the repository. It contains additional details on the application's functionality and usage.\n\n## Support\n\nIf you encounter any issues or have questions about using the Disk Space Analyzer, please feel free to reach out to our support team or open an issue on our GitHub repository.\n\n```",

    "content": "# CLI CPU Usage Monitor\n\nA command-line interface (CLI) application for monitoring CPU usage per process, similar to a simplified `top` command. This tool allows users to view CPU usage for all processes or focus on a specific process by providing its Process ID (PID).\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **Monitor CPU Usage for All Processes:** Displays a list of all running processes along with their CPU usage percentage.\n- **Focus on Specific Process:** Allows users to specify a PID to monitor CPU usage for a specific process.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.x\n- `pip` (Python package manager)\n\n### Quick Install\n\n1. **Clone the Repository:**\n\n   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   cd <repository-directory>\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Dependencies:**\n\n   Install the required Python packages using `pip`:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n   The primary dependency for this application is `psutil`, which is used for retrieving system and process information.\n\n## How to Use\n\n### Running the Application\n\n1. **Monitor All Processes:**\n\n   To start monitoring CPU usage for all processes, run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n   This will display a list of all running processes along with their CPU usage percentage, updating every 2 seconds.\n\n2. **Focus on a Specific Process:**\n\n   To monitor CPU usage for a specific process, provide the PID using the `--pid` argument:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py --pid <PID>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<PID>` with the actual Process ID you want to monitor. The application will display the CPU usage for the specified process, updating every 2 seconds.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n- To monitor all processes:\n\n  ```bash\n  python main.py\n  ```\n\n- To monitor a specific process with PID 1234:\n\n  ```bash\n  python main.py --pid 1234\n  ```\n\n### Notes\n\n- The application updates the CPU usage information every 2 seconds.\n- If a specified PID does not exist, the application will notify you with a message: \"No process found with PID <PID>\".\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor further details on the implementation and usage of this application, please refer to the source code files:\n\n- `main.py`: Contains the CLI logic and user interface.\n- `process_monitor.py`: Contains the logic for retrieving CPU usage information using the `psutil` library.\n\n## Support\n\nFor any issues or questions, please contact our support team or refer to the documentation provided in the source code.",

It provides both a CLI and an optional GUI for displaying overall memory usage and the top memory-consuming processes. The application reads data from the `/proc/meminfo` and `/proc/[pid]/status` files to gather the necessary information.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Overall Memory Usage**: Displays detailed information about the system's memory usage.\n- **Top Memory-Consuming Processes**: Lists the top processes consuming the most memory.\n- **CLI and GUI Options**: Users can choose to run the application in a command-line interface or a graphical user interface.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.x\n- Tkinter (for GUI functionality)\n\n### Quick Install\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**:\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   cd <repository-directory>\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Dependencies**:\n   Ensure you have Python and Tkinter installed. Tkinter is usually included with Python installations, but you can install it using your package manager if needed.\n\n3. **Run the Application**:\n   - For CLI:\n     ```bash\n     python main.py\n     ```\n   - For GUI:\n     ```bash\n     python main.py --gui\n     ```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Command-Line Interface (CLI)\n\n- **Display Overall Memory Usage**:\n  Run the application without any arguments to see the overall memory usage.\n  ```bash\n  python main.py\n  ```\n\n- **Display Top Memory-Consuming Processes**:\n  The CLI will automatically display the top 5 memory-consuming processes.\n\n### Graphical User Interface (GUI)\n\n- **Launch GUI**:\n  Run the application with the `--gui` flag to launch the graphical interface.\n  ```bash\n  python main.py --gui\n  ```\n\n- **Features in GUI**:\n  - The main window displays overall memory usage and top memory-consuming processes.\n  - The display updates every 5 seconds to provide real-time monitoring.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more detailed documentation and examples, please refer to the source code comments and docstrings within the Python files. The code is structured into separate modules for memory monitoring (`memory_monitor.py`), command-line interface (`cli.py`), and graphical user interface (`gui.py`).\n\n## Support\n\nFor any issues or questions, please contact our support team or open an issue in the repository.\n\n```\n```",

This tool allows you to easily create common cron job schedules and outputs the corresponding crontab line.\n\n## Quick Install\n\nThis project does not require any external dependencies. Simply clone the repository and run the script.\n\n```bash\ngit clone <repository-url>\ncd <repository-directory>\n```\n\n## \ud83e\udd14 What is this?\n\nThe CLI Cronjob Generator is designed to simplify the process of creating cron job schedules. Cron jobs are scheduled tasks in Unix-based systems that run at specified intervals. This tool provides a straightforward way to generate cron expressions for common schedules such as:\n\n- Daily at 3 AM\n- Every 15 minutes\n- Every hour\n- Weekly on Sunday\n\nAdditionally, it allows for custom cron expressions to be specified.\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 How to Use\n\n### Running the Application\n\nTo run the CLI Cronjob Generator, navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file and execute the following command:\n\n```bash\npython main.py <schedule>\n```\n\n### Available Schedules\n\nThe following predefined schedules are available:\n\n- `daily_3am`: Runs daily at 3 AM\n- `every_15_minutes`: Runs every 15 minutes\n- `every_hour`: Runs every hour\n- `weekly_sunday`: Runs weekly on Sunday\n\nExample usage:\n\n```bash\npython main.py daily_3am\n```\n\nThis command will output the cron expression for running a job daily at 3 AM.\n\n### Custom Cron Expressions\n\nIf you need to specify a custom cron expression, you can use the `--custom` flag:\n\n```bash\npython main.py --custom \"*/5 * * * *\"\n```\n\nThis command will output the custom cron expression you provided.\n\n### Output\n\nThe application will print the cron expression to the console. For example:\n\n```\nCron Expression: 0 3 * * *\n```\n\nThis output represents the cron expression for the selected schedule.\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Documentation\n\nFor more detailed information on cron expressions and how they work, please refer to the [crontab documentation](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/crontab.5.html).\n\n```",

You only need Python installed on your system.\n\n## \ud83e\udd14 What is this?\n\nThe CLI Spell Checker is a tool designed to help users identify misspelled words in a given text or text file. It uses a local dictionary file to compare words and highlights those that are not found in the dictionary.\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 Main Functions\n\n- **Load Dictionary**: Loads a list of correctly spelled words from a local dictionary file (`dictionary.txt`) into memory for quick lookup.\n- **Check Spelling**: Analyzes the input text or text file, identifies words not present in the dictionary, and highlights them as potential misspellings.\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 How to Use\n\n### 1. Prepare the Environment\n\nEnsure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### 2. Set Up the Project\n\nClone the repository or download the files to your local machine. Ensure you have the following files:\n\n- `main.py`: The main script containing the spell checker logic.\n- `dictionary.txt`: A text file containing a list of correctly spelled words.\n\n### 3. Run the Spell Checker\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file. Use the following command to run the spell checker:\n\n```bash\npython main.py <input>\n```\n\nReplace `<input>` with either a string of text you want to check or the path to a text file.\n\n#### Examples:\n\n- To check a string of text:\n\n  ```bash\n  python main.py \"This is an exmple of a txt with misspelled wrds.\"\n  ```\n\n- To check a text file:\n\n  ```bash\n  python main.py path/to/your/textfile.txt\n  ```\n\n### 4. View Results\n\nThe spell checker will output a list of misspelled words found in the input. If no misspellings are found, it will indicate that all words are correctly spelled.\n\n## \ud83d\udcc4 Documentation\n\nFor more detailed information on how the spell checker works, please refer to the comments within the `main.py` file. The code is documented to help you understand the logic and flow of the application.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Customization\n\nYou can customize the dictionary by editing the `dictionary.txt` file. Add or remove words as needed to tailor the spell checker to your specific requirements.\n\n## Support\n\nFor any issues or questions, please contact our support team at support@chatdev.com.\n\n```",

It is ideal for users who need to quickly transform CSV data into a format suitable for Markdown documentation.\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **CSV to Markdown Conversion**: The tool reads a CSV file and converts its contents into a Markdown table. The first row of the CSV is treated as the header of the table.\n- **Error Handling**: The tool provides error messages if the CSV file is empty or if any other issue occurs during the conversion process.\n\n## Quick Install\n\nTo use this tool, you need to have Python installed on your system. The tool requires Python version 3.6 or higher.\n\n### Step 1: Clone the Repository\n\nFirst, clone the repository to your local machine:\n\n```bash\ngit clone <repository-url>\ncd <repository-directory>\n```\n\n### Step 2: Install Dependencies\n\nEnsure you have the required Python version and install any necessary dependencies. You can create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:\n\n```bash\npython -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n## How to Use\n\nOnce the environment is set up, you can use the tool to convert CSV files to Markdown tables.\n\n### Command-Line Usage\n\nTo convert a CSV file to a Markdown table, run the following command:\n\n```bash\npython main.py <path-to-your-csv-file>\n```\n\nReplace `<path-to-your-csv-file>` with the actual path to your CSV file. The tool will output the Markdown table to the console.\n\n### Example\n\nSuppose you have a CSV file named `data.csv` in the current directory. You can convert it to a Markdown table by running:\n\n```bash\npython main.py data.csv\n```\n\nThe output will be a Markdown table printed to the console, which you can then copy and paste into your Markdown documents.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **Empty CSV File**: If the CSV file is empty, the tool will raise an error indicating that the file is empty.\n- **File Not Found**: Ensure the file path is correct if you encounter a file not found error.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor further details on the implementation and additional examples, please refer to the source code comments and docstrings within the `main.py` and `converter.py` files.\n\n---\n\nThis manual provides a comprehensive guide to installing and using the CSV to Markdown Converter CLI Tool.

    "content": "The error message you encountered is a common issue when trying to run a Tkinter-based GUI application in an environment that does not support a graphical display, such as a headless server or a remote terminal without X11 forwarding. The specific error is:\n\n```\n_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable\n```\n\n### Summary of the Bug:\n\n1. **Environment Issue**: The error indicates that the Tkinter library is trying to create a graphical window, but it cannot find a display to render the window. This typically happens when the application is run in an environment without a graphical user interface (GUI) support.\n\n2. **$DISPLAY Environment Variable**: The `$DISPLAY` environment variable is not set, which is necessary for GUI applications to know where to render the windows. This variable is usually set automatically in environments with a GUI, but it is absent in headless environments.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n1. **Run in a GUI Environment**: Ensure that the application is run in an environment that supports GUI applications, such as a local machine with a desktop environment.\n\n2. **Use X11 Forwarding**: If you are running the application on a remote server, use X11 forwarding to display the GUI on your local machine. This can be done by connecting to the server using SSH with the `-X` or `-Y` option (e.g., `ssh -X user@server`).\n\n3. **Virtual Display**: Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to simulate a display environment. This is useful for running GUI applications in headless environments for testing purposes.\n\n4. **Modify Code for Headless Operation**: If the GUI is not essential for your use case, consider modifying the application to run in a headless mode where it does not require a display.\n\nBy addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run your Tkinter application without encountering the `$DISPLAY` error.",
